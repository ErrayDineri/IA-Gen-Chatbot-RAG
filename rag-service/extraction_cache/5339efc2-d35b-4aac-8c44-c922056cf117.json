The only constant is change. Growth is an inevitable\nprocess of life, and it will be impossible for you not to change\nafter reading this book.\n“We cannot change what we are not aware of, and once we\nare aware, we cannot help but change.” - Sheryl Sanberg\nNo matter who you are, where you’re from, what your\nbackground is, what you’ve done and haven’t done, what status\nor wealth you do or don’t have, Martian or not, you can find\ntotal peace, unconditional love, complete fulfillment, and an\nabundance of joy in your life.

Miracles like these occur every day for many who\nunderstand the principles within this book. And this is just the\ntip of the iceberg.

They point TO the truth. Look beyond words to\nsee the truth for yourself. Truth cannot be intellectualized; it\ncan only be experienced. The truth lies within a feeling, which\nis why it cannot be formulated into a word.\nIf you want to find truth, look beyond the words, and look\nfor a feeling.\nMany who discover the truth will describe the feeling as one\nof complete peace, unconditional love, and an overwhelming\namount of joy.

Out of a fear of the unknown, they\nprefer suffering that is familiar.”\n― Thich Nhat Hanh\nThere is an important distinction to make when speaking about\nsuffering. When I mention suffering in this book, I’m referring\nto psychological and emotional suffering. There is a way in\nwhich, no matter what happens in your life, you do not have to\nsuffer emotionally and psychologically.\nI am not saying that what we go through is all in our heads\nor made up. Terrible and unfortunate events happen to people\nevery single day. What I’m saying is that although we\nexperience a lot of pain in our lives, suffering is optional.

However, the second arrow is our reaction to the\nfirst. The second arrow is optional.”\nWhen I first heard of this quote from Buddha a few years\nback, I was confounded because although I understood what he\nmeant, I didn’t know how I could apply this in my own life. If\nanyone were given the clear choice of suffering and not\nsuffering, I don’t think anyone in their right mind would choose\nto suffer.\nHow can I just choose not to suffer? If it were as easy as that I\ndon’t think anyone would be suffering anymore. It wasn’t until\nyears later that I came across a new understanding of where\nsuffering comes from that I was able to stop it at its source.\nAs I began my journey of self-improvement, I came across a\nmyriad of different teachings, studies, and methods to help\npeople overcome their problems. I read dozens, if not hundreds\nof books, studied psychology, went to therapists, listened to\nmany different thought leaders, tried changing my habits,\nwaking up at 4am, changing my diet, becoming more\nstructured and disciplined, shadow work, studying personality\ntypes, meditating daily, going on spiritual retreats, following\nspiritual masters, and researching different ancient religions.\nIf you name it, I’ve probably tried it.

The monastery was occupied by a few senior monks while\nthe rest were newcomers and still had much to learn. The\nmonks had many obligations in the monastery, but one of the\nmost important ones was their daily routine where they had to\nsit down, close their eyes, and meditate in silence for hours at a\ntime.\nAfter each meditation, they had to report their progress to\ntheir mentor. The young monk had difficulty staying focused\nduring his meditation practice for a variety of reasons, which\nmade him very mad. After the young monk reported his\nprogress, or better said, lack of it, to his mentor, the elder monk\nasked the young monk a simple question that had a hidden\nlesson, “Do you know what is really making you angry?” The\nyoung monk replied, “Well, usually as soon as I close my eyes"}, {"page_num": 20, "text": "and begin to meditate, there is someone moving around, and I\ncan’t focus. I get agitated that someone is disturbing me even\nthough they know that I’m meditating. How can they not be\nmore considerate? And then when I close my eyes again and try\nto focus, a cat or a small animal might brush past and disturb\nme again. By this point, even when the wind blows and the tree\nbranches make noise, I get angry. If that is not enough, the birds\nkeep on chirping, and I can’t seem to find any peace in this\nplace.”\nThe elder monk simply pointed out to his pupil, “I see that\nyou become angrier with each interruption you encounter. This\nis exactly the opposite of what is the point of your task when\nmeditating. You should find a way not to get angry with people,\nor animals, or any other thing around you that disturbs you\nduring your task.” After their consultation, the young monk\nwent out of the monastery and looked around to find a place\nthat would be quieter so that he could meditate peacefully. He\nfound such a place at the shore of the lake that is nearby. He\nbrought his mat, sat down, and started meditating. But soon a\nflock of birds splashed down in the lake near where the monk\nwas meditating. Hearing their noise, the monk opened his eyes\nto see what was going on.\nAlthough the bank of the lake was quieter than the\nmonastery, there were still things that would disturb his peace\nand he again got angry. Even though he didn’t find the peace he\nwas looking for, he kept returning to the lake. Then one day, the\nmonk saw a boat tied at the end of a small pier. And right then\nan idea hit him, “Why don’t I take the boat, row it down to the\nmiddle of the lake and meditate there? In the middle of the lake,\nthere will be nothing to disturb me!” He rowed the boat to the\nmiddle of the lake and started meditating."}, {"page_num": 21, "text": "As he had expected, there was nothing in the middle of the\nlake to disturb him and he was able to meditate the whole day.\nAt the end of the day, he returned to the monastery. This\ncontinued for a couple of days and the monk was thrilled that\nhe had finally found a place to meditate in peace. He hadn’t felt\nangry and could continue the meditation practice in a calm\nmanner.\nOn the third day, the monk sat in the boat, rowed to the\nmiddle of the lake, and started meditating again. A few minutes\nlater, he heard some splashing of water and felt that the boat\nwas rocking. He started getting upset that even in the middle of\nthe lake there was someone or something disturbing him.\nWhen he opened his eyes, he saw a boat heading straight\ntowards him. He shouted, “Steer your boat away, or else you will\nhit my boat.” But the other boat kept coming straight at him\nand was just a few feet away. He yelled again but nothing\nchanged and so the incoming boat hit the monk’s boat. Now he\nwas furious. He screamed, “Who are you, and why have you hit\nmy boat in the middle of this vast lake?” There was no answer.\nThis made the young monk even angrier.\nHe stood up to see who was in the other boat and to his\nsurprise, he found that there was no one in the boat.\nThe boat had probably drifted along in the breeze and had\nbumped into the monk’s boat. The monk found his anger\ndissipating. It was just an empty boat! There was no one to get\nangry at!\nAt that moment he remembered his mentors’ question, “Do\nyou know what is really making you angry?” And then\nwondered, “It’s not other people, situations, or circumstances.\nIt’s not the empty boat, but my reaction to it that causes my"}, {"page_num": 22, "text": "anger.

There were still noises and disturbances\naround, but the monk treated them as the “empty boat” and\ncontinued to meditate peacefully. When the elder monk saw the\ndifference, he simply said to the young monk, “I see that you\nhave found what is really making you angry and overcome\nthat.”\nOceanofPDF.com"}, {"page_num": 23, "text": "chapter 3\nWHY DO WE EVEN THINK?\n“I think and think and think, I’ve thought myself\nout of happiness one million times, but never once\ninto it.” — Jonathan Safran Foer\nWe as humans have evolved to develop a sophisticated ability to\nrationalize, analyze, and think because it simply helped us\nsurvive.

The only reason why I was able to\ndescribe it in painful and excruciating detail was because that\nwas my life.\nHere’s the good news: it’s not your fault that you set goals\nthat way if you are and there’s a way out. It’s through creating\ngoals and dreams out of inspiration instead of desperation.\nWhen we create goals out of inspiration versus desperation,\nit is a completely different story. In this state, we are creating\nbecause we feel deeply moved, inspired, and expansive. It feels\nlike a calling rather than an obligation. It is like there’s a\npowerful force of life coming from within us, wanting to be\nexpressed through us to be made manifested into the physical\nworld. This is why painters paint, why dancers dance, why\nwriters write and why singers sing, even if they never get paid\nor make a living from it. We feel pulled by a force to create\nsomething. We gravitate towards it. We feel compelled to do it.\nWhen we feel like this, we are creating from a place of\nabundance instead of lack.\nMost surprising of all is that in this state, we are creating not\nfor any reason at all, other than because we simply want to. We\ndon’t create because we feel like we HAVE to. We create because"}, {"page_num": 51, "text": "we simply want to and there’s no other reason. We aren’t\ncreating these goals so that we can do something else or use it\nas a means to get something else we want. This creating comes\nfrom a place of wholeness and abundance. It’s an overflowing of\nlove and joy for life. This is the reason why most of us want or\nhave kids. It’s not so that we can milk our kids for their money\nonce they’re old enough to work and hopefully use them as a\nretirement plan. We want to have kids because we want to share\nthe abundance of what we have with them, and it comes from a\nplace of sharing what we have lots of versus trying to get\nsomething out of them.\nThis feeling of deep inspiration is incredibly difficult to\ndescribe because it does not come from this world. It really\ndoesn’t come from us, but through us from something greater\nthan us. I like to call this feeling divine inspiration because the\nideas and vision we have of what we want to create seem to be\nfar bigger than we could have possibly imagined or come up\nwith ourselves. Since divine inspiration doesn’t come from us\nbut from something greater, it doesn’t analyze or rely on past\ndata or what you or anyone in the world has already\naccomplished. Divine inspiration is what happens when\ngroundbreaking creations and inventions are created that\nseemed to be impossible not too long ago. It knows no\nboundaries, limits, or constraints. It is an incredibly expansive\nforce that energizes and lifts us, making us feel like we’re “high”\non life. In this state, we feel whole, complete, filled with\nunconditional love, joy, and peace. We don’t analyze, compare,\ncriticize, judge, or rationalize anything, but instead we truly\nlive, love, share, give, create, grow, and nourish. It really is one\nof the greatest feelings we can experience, and it is truly a gift\nthat we can experience the divine as humans (and it’s because\nwe’re from the same source)."}, {"page_num": 52, "text": "Everyone has experienced this deep feeling and desire to\ncreate something marvelous in the world that’s out of pure\ninspiration and not desperation.

Pause here and\nspend a few minutes thinking about times in your life where\nyou felt an overwhelming feeling and desire to create\nsomething magnificent because you felt deeply inspired and\ncalled to. It doesn’t matter if you actually created it or not, but\njust think of a time where you felt that feeling to create out of\ninspiration.\nIsn’t that just one of the most amazing feelings in the entire\nworld? Most of us feel this divine inspiration, but then suppress\nit as soon as we begin thinking about doing it. We begin to think\nourselves into doubt, rationalize why we can’t do it, tell\nourselves that it is unrealistic, how we should focus on more\nimportant things, and that we’re not good enough to do it. As\nsoon as we begin to think about the thought of us wanting to\ncreate, it completely shuts off the source of that inspiration and\nwe go back to living life as usual. When we cut off that source,\nwe also cut off the feelings of abundance, exuberance, ecstasy,\njoy, pure unconditional love, and go back to the feelings of\ndoubt, anxiety, frustration, sadness, and feel confined, stuck,\nand frustrated with our lives.\nWe can only ever follow one calling at a time, either\ninspiration or desperation in the present moment.

When we follow\ndivine inspiration, we feel alive, whole, joy, love, peace, and\nfulfillment.\nSo how can we tell when a goal or dream is created out of\ninspiration or desperation?\nA simple way to know if a goal or dream is created out of\ninspiration is to remember the distinction between thoughts\nand thinking. Goals and dreams that come in the form of\nthought are created out of inspiration. Goals and dreams that\ncome from thinking are created out of desperation.\nTypically, when we think, we’ll analyze, judge, criticize,\nrationalize, and use our past to try to create our new goals, but\nthis form of creating goals feels extremely restricting and\nlimiting. We don’t typically feel good when creating these types\nof goals and when we’re pursuing them, we do not feel great\neither, since it’s all out of desperation.\nAnother way to identify the two is to sense how you feel\nenergetically. Goals and dreams created out of desperation will\nfeel very heavy, draining, confining, and empty. We tend to feel\na lot of scarcity, fear, and stress, like we HAVE to do it or that we\nare obligated to. With these types of goals, it seems like if we do\nnot accomplish it, that there will be dire consequences, hence\nthe high pressure and stakes (I’m sure you can see now how this\ncan create the feeling of desperation). Moreover, we feel like\nwe’re trying to accomplish these goals to escape our current\nsituation and get out of something. Our goals created in this\nstate are typically means goals, meaning that we want to\nachieve these goals so that we can do something else\nafterwards, such as having the goal to quit our job. Most likely\nyou’ll have this goal because you want to go do something you"}, {"page_num": 54, "text": "actually enjoy, but you can see how the goal of quitting your job\nis just a means goal for you to go do something else. Or having a\ngoal of making $1 million is typically set because you want to\nhave financial freedom and go travel the world. These goals are\nalways a means to an end and not the end itself. There’s always\na reason that we want to accomplish these goals and it makes us\nfeel very empty inside.\nI want to emphasize that none of these goals are inherently\nbad or that we shouldn’t have goals of wanting to make money\nor quitting our jobs. If those goals are created from inspiration,\nthat is completely different. It just depends on the source of the\ngoals and not necessarily the goal itself. This is an important\ndistinction to make, otherwise you’ll spend most of your time\ndebating and stressing yourself out over if this is the right goal\nfor you or not.\nThere is no right or wrong goal, only goals created from\ninspiration or desperation. It just depends on how you want to\nfeel inside and when you’re aware of these two types of goals\nand how they manifest, then you’ll be able to feel blissful as you\ngo about creating amazing things in your life.\nOn the other hand, goals and dreams created out of\ninspiration (which comes from thought) feel very light,\nenergizing, uplifting, and expansive. We tend to feel excited,\njoyful, and most importantly, inspired. We don’t feel like we\nHAVE to create it, but that we WANT to. Instead of feeling like\nyou NEED to do this, you feel inspired to. There is virtually no\npressure because we’re not trying to get out of something or\nescape our current situation by accomplishing this goal. There\nis no scarcity or urgency because we don’t feel like we’re\ncreating from a place of lack, but instead from a place of\nabundance and we just want to share it with the world.

It’s not a\nmeans goal, but simply an end in and of itself. There is no\n“reason” we need to create it. We are not creating so that we can\nfeel whole, but we are creating because we feel whole and want\nto give from that place, not expecting anything from it.\nI’m sure you can see the stark difference between the two\nnow and that you can tell which type your goals currently fall\nunder. If most of your goals fall under the category of\ndesperation, don’t worry because most people have goals\ncreated from desperation, including myself before I knew a\nbetter way.\nSo how do we create goals and dreams out of inspiration\nversus desperation?\nCreating goals and dreams from divine inspiration isn’t\nsomething you have to try to do. We naturally have thoughts of\ninfinite inspiration all the time. If you look at children, they\nnaturally have the wildest dreams and imaginations of what\nthey want to do. It almost doesn’t even register in their minds\nthat they can’t do something most of the time. The only\ndifference between us and children is that we have learned to\nshut down all these thoughts of inspiration which contain our\ndreams, hopes, and goals that we truly want to see manifested\nin the world. Our minds are filled more with reasons of why we\ncan’t than thoughts of what we want to create.\nWe innately have an infinite flow of inspiration that comes\nthrough us, but we block that flow as soon as we begin thinking\nabout the thoughts we have, which causes self-doubt, self-\nsabotage, and anxiety. Think of the flow of inspiration to create\nlike a river. The river always flows until man puts something\nthere to block it, like a dam. Then when the dam is there, we ask"}, {"page_num": 56, "text": "why there are so many fish dying, animals disappearing, and\nforests dwindling, when all we need to do was return the river\nback to its natural state and everything will be working\nperfectly fine, the way nature intended it to.\nThis is the same for our minds and our goals. We always\ndream, have big goals, and know what to do at all times when\nwe’re tapped into our inner wisdom and inner intelligence, free\nfrom thinking. If we simply do not think about our thoughts,\nany sort of thoughts about dreams, goals, and desires that\nnaturally arise are all from the divine and that is how you\n“create” goals out of inspiration versus desperation.\nA question that greatly helps me to settle the thinking and\ntap into the limitless well of possibilities of what I could create\nis:\n“If I had infinite money, already traveled the world, had no\nfear, and didn’t receive any recognition for what I do, what\nwould I do or what would I create?”\nWhenever we ask questions, answers always arise. It is\nimpossible for our brains to hear a question and not come up\nwith a response. So when you ask yourself this question,\nwhatever begins to come up for you without any manual\nthinking will be from the divine and from inspiration versus\ndesperation.\nThe way the question is worded is extremely important\nbecause it removes most of the thinking, fear, criticism, and\nexternal reasons of why you would want to do something, so it\nfocuses your answer on what you truly want to create (usually\nit’s for no reason other than you just wanting to create it\nbecause it’s fun), without any influences from the material\nworld."}, {"page_num": 57, "text": "Try asking the question and seeing what comes up for you!\nYou’ll be surprised at what surfaces, but don’t get caught up\nwith your thinking when those true dreams of yours begin to be\nrevealed to you.\nTo a mind without the limits of thinking, anything is\npossible.\nOceanofPDF.com"}, {"page_num": 58, "text": "chapter 10\nUNCONDITIONAL LOVE &\nCREATION\n“The greatest power that mankind could ever\nachieve is the power of unconditional love.

Those who have the faith and\ncourage to do this, will discover the true joy, peace, and love\nthey have been looking for while enjoying the miracle of life.\nSo how do we know what to do without thinking?\nThe truth is most of us know what to do, but we are just\nafraid to do it. For instance, if we want to lose weight, most of\nus know exactly what we need to do. The formula to losing\nweight isn’t rocket science or written in hieroglyphics. Most of\nus know that all we need to do is burn more calories than we\nconsume, workout and eat healthy foods and we’ll lose weight.\nFor anything in life, you most likely already know deep down\nwhat to do, but are afraid of doing it or don’t believe that you\nare good enough to do it.\nThe first step is realizing that you already know what to do,\nyou just think you don’t because of fear or self-doubt. If you\ndon’t have any fear or self-doubt about the situation and still\nsee that you don’t know what to do, then the next step is to\ntrust your inner wisdom (Infinite Intelligence) that it will give\nyou the answers you need. We have the ability to access an\ninfinite number of thoughts, so there’s definitely no shortage of\nideas on what you can do in any given moment. The only thing\nthat is stopping us from accessing this abundance of knowledge\nis our own thinking.\nHenry Ford once said, “Whether you think that you can or\ncan’t, you’re right.” If we walk around our lives thinking we\ncan’t, then we immediately block ourselves from the limitless\npossibilities of what we can do in any given moment in time."}, {"page_num": 73, "text": "But when we release the brake in our mind and realize that it’s\njust our thinking holding us back, we automatically return to\nour natural state of abundance and unlimited possibilities and\nin that moment, we can receive any answer we need on what to\ndo.\nIn short, know that you already know and if you don’t know,\nknow that you can know what you need to know.\nIf you know that you can always know, then what you need\nto know will always come to you.

The state of\nflow is a state of pure oneness and a direct connection to\neverything around us. Because there is no separation when we\nare in that state, we can also say that it is a state where we are in\ndirect connection and alignment with God/Universe/Infinite\nIntelligence.\nWhat thinking does is sever this connection we have with\nthe divine, causing us to feel stress, frustration, anger,\nresentment, depression, and all of these negative emotions"}, {"page_num": 75, "text": "many of us feel on a daily basis. This is why some religions\ndescribe Hell as the complete separation from God.\nFrom now on for simplicity’s sake, I’ll be using the term\nnonthinking instead of flow, but they really are synonymous\nwhen I use them in this book. This state of non-thinking also\nmeans a direct connection to Infinite Intelligence.\nMany will attribute the state of non-thinking or flow with a\nparticular activity that we love to do and that’s the only time we\ncan be in flow. This is far from the truth. We can be in a state of\nnonthinking at any point in time. The only time we can really\nbe in a state of non-thinking is in the present moment. We can\nonly see reality in the present moment and when we are\nactively thinking, it means we are either in the past or future\n(which don’t exist). Only in the present moment can the truth\nbe found. This is why all of the spiritual masters and leaders\nalways teach to meditate, pray, and to be in the present\nmoment. In the Bible, when Moses asks God her name, She\nreplies with “I am.” God didn’t say that She was or will be\n(because they don’t exist), but simply with “I am.” God, truth,\nthe Universe, freedom, peace, joy, and love (these terms are all\nsynonymous) can only be found, and therefore experienced, in\nthe present.\nWhen you’re following your intuition, it means you are\ntrusting yourself and having faith that you always have the\ninner wisdom necessary to help guide you through everything\nin life. This is a state of non-thinking or flow.\nLet’s explore how we can make this concept practical and\nbring it into our everyday lives. What does following your\nintuition and inner wisdom look like and how can we do it?"}, {"page_num": 76, "text": "When you’re following your intuition, you’re completely\ntapped into something greater than your personal self. You’re in\na state of nonthinking (flow) and direct connection with God. In\nthis state, you always know what you need to do without\nthinking and are guided by Infinite Intelligence. It almost\nseems like we’re not doing anything when we’re in this zone\nbecause we lose our sense of personal self and become one with\nlife. When we’re in this state, miracles occur such as business\ndeals coming out of nowhere, people showing up at the right\nplace at the right time, money comes in exactly when we need\nit, connections that we were looking for spontaneously fall\nupon our laps, and life seems almost magical. Time seems to\nwarp and bend around us and it’s because there is no sense of it.\nWe proceed to then accomplish more within a few days than\nothers do within a month. Abundance, love, joy, peace,\nharmony, and gratitude are inevitable and inseparable feelings\nthat are experienced in this state.\nEvery single person has experienced instances where they\nhave felt like this before. Although many have experienced this\nphenomenon, very few are able to maintain it for extended\nperiods of time. The main reason is because most relapse back\ninto thinking and believe that they have to “figure it out”\nthemselves. It is when we begin thinking that we lose this\npower of creating miracle-like events and circumstances.\nThe truth is that we don’t have to have it all figured out, nor\ndo we even have to figure it all out. How can our limited minds\npossibly understand and try to manipulate the entire world to\nour desires?\nIt is only when we think we know more than God that we run\ninto problems."}, {"page_num": 77, "text": "The great news is that we don’t have to know more than Her\nnor do we have to even think. All we have to do is trust in our\nown intuition and have faith that our inner wisdom will show\nus the way that is best for us. When you ask people who are the\nmost abundant, joyful, and successful how they made it, they\nwill usually attribute their success to some sort of higher power\nor luck. These people have trusted in something greater than\nthemselves and thus attribute it to that instead of attributing\ntheir success to sheer willpower and brute force.\nThere’s so much in life that is completely out of our control\nand we can really only control a very small portion of it. This is\nnot to say that we give up because we can’t control our lives, it’s\nquite the opposite. When we realize that we don’t have to\ncontrol and try to force everything to happen our way, we\nbecome free from suffering, pain, and frustration and begin to\nfall into this state of non-thinking where things just all happen\nfor us instead of to us. We begin to see that everything was\nperfectly placed in our lives to help us become the exact person\nwe are now and that if anything were changed, we would not\nhave what we do now. There are millions of small\ncircumstances and events that have to have been meticulously\norchestrated for us to be where we are now. To plan that would\nbe impossible and futile, yet here we are. This is the miracle of\nlife.\nTo go back on a point we just made about us not having to\ncontrol things in our lives, there’s a caveat I want to highlight. It\nis true that we cannot control everything that happens in our\nlives, but what we can control is whether we think or not\n(which is the root cause of all of our problems and negative\nemotions).

For instance,\nwe have the gift of imagination (access to Infinite Intelligence),\nwhich means we can come up with anything that we want in\nour lives.

This is why people believe that we\nhave to work hard and suffer for what we want in life. That is\nsimply not true. It is only true if we think we have to figure out\nthe “how” to get what we want in life. Our job is to come up\nwith what we want, not how to get it. The how is really up to\nthe Universe. This is the best-case scenario anyway because\nthere are an infinite number of ways to bring about what you\nwant in life, so for our little finite brains to figure it out would\nbe futile, nonetheless.\nWe only suffer when we try to figure it all out, but we don’t\nhave to. This is when we want to rely on our intuition and inner\nwisdom to help show us exactly what we need to do in real time\nto manifest what we want. There’s no need to try to figure it all\nout in advance. Our part is to hold in our minds what we want\nand get into a state of non-thinking.

We\ncan always get what we desire in life, it just may not be on our\ntimeline or in the way we want it to manifest.\nOur intuition and inner wisdom (God) actually speaks to us\nall of the time. You know that small voice inside that always\nknows what you should do? Maybe it’s to leave your job, forgive a\nperson that hurt you, ask someone out, or reconnect with\nsomeone. It’s that gut feeling you get where you know what you\nneed to do. Have you ever regretted not doing something in a\nmoment your gut told you to do it? Have you ever had a gut\nfeeling to do something, but you have no logical reasoning as to\nwhy, but you did it anyway and amazing things happened\nafterward? That is your intuition.\nOur intuition does come to us in the form of thoughts, but\nremember that there’s a stark difference between thoughts and\nthinking, as we discussed in a previous chapter. Thoughts are\ndivine by nature and feel like they pop into our minds out of\nnowhere.

Fear.\nListening to our intuition can be scary or extremely\ndaunting. This is because our intuition lives in the space of the\nunknown. In order words, our intuition is spiritual and\noperates in the field of infinite possibilities, which by nature is\nthe field of unknown. We as humans always fear the unknown\nbecause we can’t predict what might happen. It is only when we\nstep into the unknown that we can begin to experience the\nlimitless possibilities that life can bring to us. This is why\nmagical things and miracles happen when we trust our\nintuition. We are literally stepping into the zone of pure\npossibility.

They try to use their limited personal mind\nto create something they have never experienced before,\ninnocently not realizing that they must step into the unknown\nby entering the state of non-thinking and listening to their\nintuition. We can only ever create something we have never\nexperienced in the realm of infinite possibilities, but the only\nway to make that happen is to go where we haven’t gone before,\nwhich is the unknown.\nIn summary, your intuition always knows what you need to\ndo in the present moment, but the only way to access it is by\ngetting into a state of non-thinking. Your personal mind will\nfreak out because you’re stepping into the space of infinite\npossibilities (the unknown), but if you remember that it is just\nthinking that is making you feel fear, the fearful thinking will\nfall away and the courage you need to act on your intuition will\nnaturally surface.

I recognize that\nit’s not how big a miracle is that’s important but\nhow much room I create for it.”\n― Kyle Gray\nThe Story of the Zen Master and a Scholar - Empty Your Cup\nOnce upon a time, there was a wise Zen master. People traveled\nfrom far away to seek his help. In return, he would teach them\nand show them the way to enlightenment. On this particular\nday, a scholar came to visit the master for advice. “I have come to\nask you to teach me about Zen,” the scholar said.\nSoon, it became obvious that the scholar was full of his own\nopinions and knowledge. He interrupted the master repeatedly\nwith his own stories and failed to listen to what the master had\nto say. The master calmly suggested that they should have tea.\nSo the master gently poured his guest a cup. The cup was\nfilled, yet he kept pouring until the cup overflowed onto the\ntable, onto the floor, and finally onto the scholar’s robes. The"}, {"page_num": 84, "text": "scholar cried, “Stop! The cup is full already. Can’t you see?”\n“Exactly,” the Zen master replied with a smile. “You are like this\ncup — so full of ideas that nothing more will fit in. Come back to\nme with an empty cup.”\nIt is ironic how much could be written about nothing. That’s\nwhat space is: nothing. When we study the Universe and\nquantum physics, we realize that everything comes from\nnothing. Therefore, the great spiritual masters call this The\nGreat Nothingness. For there to be creation, there must first be\nspace. The same is true for our own minds. If you want\nsomething new to be created, such as new thoughts, then you\nmust first create space so that you can receive new ideas that\ncan change your life. Just like the teacup, if your mind is\ncompletely full of old thinking, it is impossible to have any new\nthoughts come into your mind to create the change you seek.\nThe way we can create this space is through non-thinking.\nAs soon as we stop our strenuous efforts to think, we\nimmediately create space where new thoughts and ideas can\nenter our minds. Questions that challenge our current way of\nthinking are also a great way to create space in our minds.\nAll the magic happens in this space of nothingness. For\ninstance, great athletes go through intense periods of training,\nbut the best athletes know that they need an equally intense\nperiod of rest afterwards to stay in peak performance. It is\nduring this rest period that they recover, build muscle, and\nbecome stronger. This space they create for themselves through\nrest is where everything they wanted from the workout\nmanifests.\nWhen Thomas Edison was confronted with a particularly\nchallenging problem, he would sleep in his chair while holding\na steel ball in each of his hands.

I understand this is a very bold statement, but\nyou will shortly see why I have complete confidence in saying\nthis.\nWhat I know to be the truth from the depths of my soul is\nthat you will not be the same person as you were after you read\nthis book. The only constant is change. Growth is an inevitable\nprocess of life, and it will be impossible for you not to change\nafter reading this book.\n“We cannot change what we are not aware of, and once we\nare aware, we cannot help but change.” - Sheryl Sanberg\nNo matter who you are, where you’re from, what your\nbackground is, what you’ve done and haven’t done, what status\nor wealth you do or don’t have, Martian or not, you can find\ntotal peace, unconditional love, complete fulfillment, and an\nabundance of joy in your life. I promise that you are not the\nexception, even though it may seem like it. Love knows no\nboundaries. An open mind and a willing heart are all you need\nto receive every answer you’ve been looking for.\n\nAnd yes, there are extremely practical implications and\nbyproducts of understanding what is inside of this book, which\nmany of my coaching clients have experienced, such as: a 2-5x\nincrease in income, exponential growth in their businesses,\ndeeper and more harmonious relationships, overcoming\nlifelong \naddictions, \nthe \nspontaneous \ndisappearance \nof\ndestructive habits, an increase in health, vitality, and overall\nenergy. Miracles like these occur every day for many who\nunderstand the principles within this book. And this is just the\ntip of the iceberg. If I were to just list some of the improvements\nand results people have gotten from this understanding, more\nthan half of this book would just be stories of such miracles that\nhappen daily.\nI am reluctant to mention any of these “external” results\nbecause it is not the point of this book. These physical\nmanifestations \nare \nthe \nbyproduct \nof \nthis \ninside-out\nunderstanding of how our experiences of life work. In actuality,\nwe only want these external results like money and significance\nbecause we want to experience certain feelings inside such as\nlove, joy, peace, and fulfillment. The feeling is really what we\nwant in our lives, not the physical things, but the trap is that we\nbelieve the physical things will give us those feelings. The secret\nlies within the feeling.\nThis book will help guide you to understand how to uncover\nthe truth you already know inside and discover these feelings\nyou’ve been looking for your entire life.\nNow let’s get into the guide of how to go through this book.\nDon’t read this book for information, read it for insight.\nInsight (or wisdom) can only be found within. That is why it is\ncalled insight (inside). To find everything you’re looking for in\nlife, you must look inside yourself and discover the wisdom that\n\nalready exists within you. All the answers lie deep within your\nsoul. This book is merely a guide to help you look in the right\nplace. I truly admire anyone who still has the hope that what\nthey’re looking for is still out there. This means you have hope.\nWithout hope, we have nothing, so the fact that you’re here,\nreading this now, is a testament to your faith, courage, and\nstrength. I know with one hundred percent certainty that you\nwill find what you’re looking for if you continue down the path\nyou’re on with the hope you have in your heart.\nI want to make it clear that this book is not the only book\nthat contains truth. The truth lies within everyone and in\neverything. You must look beyond the form (the physical) to see\nand experience the truth (the spiritual). The words in this book\nare not truth. They point TO the truth. Look beyond words to\nsee the truth for yourself. Truth cannot be intellectualized; it\ncan only be experienced. The truth lies within a feeling, which\nis why it cannot be formulated into a word.\nIf you want to find truth, look beyond the words, and look\nfor a feeling.\nMany who discover the truth will describe the feeling as one\nof complete peace, unconditional love, and an overwhelming\namount of joy. People also describe it as the most familiar\nunfamiliar feeling. It feels like you’re finally home. Look for that\nfeeling, and everything will be revealed to you. In this book, I\nwill not say anything that you don’t already know deep inside\nyour soul. This is why it will be a familiar unfamiliar feeling\nwhen you experience the truth.\nDon’t try to use your intellect to figure it out — you won’t. As\nsoon as you intellectualize it, you’ve missed it. The truth does\nnot come from memorizing a sentence or two. A child can do\nthat, but they will not understand the truth. The truth comes in\n\nthe form of a feeling. From that feeling will come the wisdom\nand truth you’re looking for, which will set you free. That’s\nwhat we’re all ultimately seeking, isn’t it?\nWhat I will unveil to you in this book will seem simple. It\nwill seem almost too simple, and your brain (ego) will try to\nfight it or attempt to make it more complex. It will think that it\ncan’t be this simple. When that time comes, I want you to\nremember that the truth is always simple. What is complex can\nalways be broken down into its smaller counterparts. The truth\ncannot be broken down into smaller constituents, which is\nwhat makes it truth. This is why truth is always simple. If you\nwant to find the truth, look for simplicity.\nApproach this book with an open mind and a heart of pure\nintention to know the truth and you’ll receive everything\nyou’ve been searching for.\nBefore we move on, I want to take a moment to express my\ndeepest gratitude for you being here and sharing your time and\nattention with me. Those are some of the most valuable life\nforces you could give to another, so thank you for that gift to\nme, which you are also giving to yourself. Never forget your\nown divinity because it is only through our divinity that we\nhave our humanity.\nWith Love & Light,\nJoseph\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nchapter 1\nTHE JOURNEY TO FINDING THE\nROOT CAUSE OF SUFFERING\n“People have a hard time letting go of their\nsuffering. Out of a fear of the unknown, they\nprefer suffering that is familiar.”\n― Thich Nhat Hanh\nThere is an important distinction to make when speaking about\nsuffering. When I mention suffering in this book, I’m referring\nto psychological and emotional suffering. There is a way in\nwhich, no matter what happens in your life, you do not have to\nsuffer emotionally and psychologically.\nI am not saying that what we go through is all in our heads\nor made up. Terrible and unfortunate events happen to people\nevery single day. What I’m saying is that although we\nexperience a lot of pain in our lives, suffering is optional. In\nother words, pain is unavoidable, but how we react to the events\nand circumstances that happen in our lives is up to us, and that\nwill dictate whether we suffer or not.\n\nBuddhists say that anytime we experience a negative event\nin our lives, two arrows fly our way. Being physically struck by\nan arrow is painful. Being struck by a second emotional arrow is\neven more painful (suffering).\nThe Buddha explained, “In life, we can’t always control the\nfirst arrow. However, the second arrow is our reaction to the\nfirst. The second arrow is optional.”\nWhen I first heard of this quote from Buddha a few years\nback, I was confounded because although I understood what he\nmeant, I didn’t know how I could apply this in my own life. If\nanyone were given the clear choice of suffering and not\nsuffering, I don’t think anyone in their right mind would choose\nto suffer.\nHow can I just choose not to suffer? If it were as easy as that I\ndon’t think anyone would be suffering anymore. It wasn’t until\nyears later that I came across a new understanding of where\nsuffering comes from that I was able to stop it at its source.\nAs I began my journey of self-improvement, I came across a\nmyriad of different teachings, studies, and methods to help\npeople overcome their problems. I read dozens, if not hundreds\nof books, studied psychology, went to therapists, listened to\nmany different thought leaders, tried changing my habits,\nwaking up at 4am, changing my diet, becoming more\nstructured and disciplined, shadow work, studying personality\ntypes, meditating daily, going on spiritual retreats, following\nspiritual masters, and researching different ancient religions.\nIf you name it, I’ve probably tried it. I was desperate to find\nan answer because I wanted to know how to stop suffering in\nmy own life as well as help others do the same. Although some\nof these things did help me improve incrementally, it didn’t\n\nstop my suffering. I still always felt extremely anxious, fearful,\nunfulfilled, irritated, angry, frustrated, and heavy every day.\nEven after doing all of that, I still didn’t discover the answer\nand, if I’m being honest, I was even more lost than before I\nstarted on this quest.\nI felt purposeless, hopeless, and directionless. I didn’t know\nwhat to do anymore, where to look, or who to talk to. It wasn’t\nuntil I was in my darkest hour that a glimmer of hope began to\nlead me to the light.\nAll of the sudden, after years and years of searching, I\nstumbled upon one of my first mentors that taught me how to\nbecome a coach and he revealed to me the answer of how I can\nalleviate my own suffering.\nThe answer I discovered was in the understanding of how\nour minds work and how the human experience is created.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nchapter 2\nTHE ROOT CAUSE OF ALL\nSUFFERING\n“One who looks around him is intelligent, one who\nlooks within him is wise.”\n― Matshona Dhliwayo\nWe live in a world of thought, not reality. Sydney Banks once\nsaid, “Thought is not reality; yet it is through thought that our\nrealities are created.” Each of us lives through our own\nperceptions of the world, which are vastly different from the\nperson right next to us. An example of this is that you could be\nsitting in a coffee shop having a quarter-life existential crisis,\ncompletely stressed out of your mind about how you have no\nidea what you’re doing with your life when it seems like\neveryone else has theirs together, while the person next to you\nis happily enjoying their freshly brewed drink while peacefully\npeople watching. You both are in the same exact coffee shop,\nsmelling the same aroma, surrounded by the same strangers,\nbut how the world looks to both of you couldn’t be more\ndifferent. Many of us go through the exact same events or are in\n\nthe same location at the same time yet are having completely\ndifferent experiences of the world.\nHere’s another example of how we live in a world of thought\nand not reality. If you walk up to 100 different people and ask\neach of them what money means to them, how many different\nanswers do you think you’ll get? Close to 100 different answers!\nMoney is technically the same thing, but it means something\ndifferent to each person. Money could mean time, freedom,\nopportunity, security, peace of mind, or it could mean evil,\ngreed, and the reason why people commit crimes. For now, I’m\nnot going to get into which one is right or wrong (hint: there is\nno right or wrong answer, but that’s for a different chapter).\nAnother illustration of this concept is as follows: If you\nsurvey 100 different people and ask each of them what they\nthink of our current president, how many different answers do\nyou think you’ll get?\nEven though it is the same exact person we’re talking about,\nwe will get 100 different answers because most people live in\ntheir own thoughts and perceptions of the world. The meaning\n(or thinking) we give an event is what determines how we\nultimately feel about it. That meaning or thinking is the filter\nthrough which we see life from then on — because of this, we\nlive through a perception of reality, not in reality itself. Reality\nis that the event happened, with no meaning, thinking, or\ninterpretation of it.\nAny meaning or thinking we give the event is on us and that\nis how our perception of reality is created. This is how our\nexperience of life is created from the inside out.\nIt’s not about the events that happen in our lives, but our\ninterpretation of them, which causes us to feel good or bad\n\nabout something. This is how people in third world countries\ncan be happier than people in first world countries and people\nin first world countries can be more miserable than people in\nthird world countries.\nOur feelings do not come from external events, but from\nour own thinking about the events. Therefore, we can only\never feel what we are thinking.\nLet’s hypothetically say that you really hate your job, and it\ncauses you an enormous amount of stress, anxiety, and\nfrustration. It pains you to even set foot in the building where\nyou work and just thinking about your job makes you furious.\nWhen you’re thinking about your job, you’re just sitting there\non a sofa with your family watching a TV show together, but\nyou are fuming at the thought of your job. Everyone else is\nhaving a good time, except you.\nIn this moment, everyone else in your family is having a\ndifferent experience of life than you, even though the same\nevent is happening. Just the thought of work created a whole\ndifferent perception of reality, even though you’re not\nphysically at work.\nIf it were true that external events cause us to feel the way\nwe feel inside, then you should be a happy camper in your\nliving room, watching a funny TV show with your family every\nsingle time you do this activity — but that’s not the case.\nNow, you may be saying that you’re only feeling this way\nbecause an external event, your job, is causing you to feel\nstressed and anxious. To that I’ll ask the question, is it\nabsolutely true that every single person feels the exact same\nway about the job they’re working in?\n\nTwo different people can be doing the exact same job but will\nhave completely different experiences of that job. It can be the\nmost amazing experience and a dream job for one person but be\nanother person’s worst nightmare and living hell. The only\ndifference between one person and the other is how they think\nabout their job, which determines how they ultimately feel\nabout it.\nNow let’s go back to the original scenario of you\nhypothetically hating your job. Remember how much stress,\nanxiety, and frustration it causes you when you think about it?\nLet’s do a quick thought experiment about that by\nanswering the question below:\nWho would you be without that thought that you hated\nyour job?\nTake 1 minute to see what comes up for you and don’t move\non until you do that.\nIf you don’t overthink it and truly let the answers surface\nfrom within you, without that thought, you will most likely feel\nand be happy, peaceful, free, and light.\nWithout our usual thinking about a particular event or\nthing, our experience of it completely alters. This is how we live\nin a world of thought, not reality, and how our perception of\nreality is created from the inside out, through our own\nthinking. With this new understanding, you’ve just uncovered\nthe cause of all our human psychological suffering…\nThe root cause of our suffering is our own thinking.\nNow before you throw this book across the room and light it\non fire, I’m not saying that this is all in our heads and that it\n\nisn’t real. Our perception of reality is very real. We will feel what\nwe think, and our feelings are real. That is completely\nundeniable. However, our thinking will look like an inevitable,\nunchangeable reality to us until we begin seeing how our reality\nis created. If we know that we can only ever feel what we are\nthinking, then we know that we can change our feelings by\nchanging our thinking. Thus, we can change our experience of\nlife by knowing that it comes from our own thinking. And if\nthat is true, then we are ever only one thought away from\nexperiencing something different and transforming our entire\nlives at any moment — through a state of no thought.\nIn short, the moment we stop thinking is when our\nhappiness begins.\nA Young Monk & the Empty Boat (A Zen Story About How\nThinking is the Cause of Our Own Suffering)\nA long time ago, a young Zen monk was living in a small\nmonastery that was located in a forest which was near a small\nlake. The monastery was occupied by a few senior monks while\nthe rest were newcomers and still had much to learn. The\nmonks had many obligations in the monastery, but one of the\nmost important ones was their daily routine where they had to\nsit down, close their eyes, and meditate in silence for hours at a\ntime.\nAfter each meditation, they had to report their progress to\ntheir mentor. The young monk had difficulty staying focused\nduring his meditation practice for a variety of reasons, which\nmade him very mad. After the young monk reported his\nprogress, or better said, lack of it, to his mentor, the elder monk\nasked the young monk a simple question that had a hidden\nlesson, “Do you know what is really making you angry?” The\nyoung monk replied, “Well, usually as soon as I close my eyes\n\nand begin to meditate, there is someone moving around, and I\ncan’t focus. I get agitated that someone is disturbing me even\nthough they know that I’m meditating. How can they not be\nmore considerate? And then when I close my eyes again and try\nto focus, a cat or a small animal might brush past and disturb\nme again. By this point, even when the wind blows and the tree\nbranches make noise, I get angry. If that is not enough, the birds\nkeep on chirping, and I can’t seem to find any peace in this\nplace.”\nThe elder monk simply pointed out to his pupil, “I see that\nyou become angrier with each interruption you encounter. This\nis exactly the opposite of what is the point of your task when\nmeditating. You should find a way not to get angry with people,\nor animals, or any other thing around you that disturbs you\nduring your task.” After their consultation, the young monk\nwent out of the monastery and looked around to find a place\nthat would be quieter so that he could meditate peacefully. He\nfound such a place at the shore of the lake that is nearby. He\nbrought his mat, sat down, and started meditating. But soon a\nflock of birds splashed down in the lake near where the monk\nwas meditating. Hearing their noise, the monk opened his eyes\nto see what was going on.\nAlthough the bank of the lake was quieter than the\nmonastery, there were still things that would disturb his peace\nand he again got angry. Even though he didn’t find the peace he\nwas looking for, he kept returning to the lake. Then one day, the\nmonk saw a boat tied at the end of a small pier. And right then\nan idea hit him, “Why don’t I take the boat, row it down to the\nmiddle of the lake and meditate there? In the middle of the lake,\nthere will be nothing to disturb me!” He rowed the boat to the\nmiddle of the lake and started meditating.\n\nAs he had expected, there was nothing in the middle of the\nlake to disturb him and he was able to meditate the whole day.\nAt the end of the day, he returned to the monastery. This\ncontinued for a couple of days and the monk was thrilled that\nhe had finally found a place to meditate in peace. He hadn’t felt\nangry and could continue the meditation practice in a calm\nmanner.\nOn the third day, the monk sat in the boat, rowed to the\nmiddle of the lake, and started meditating again. A few minutes\nlater, he heard some splashing of water and felt that the boat\nwas rocking. He started getting upset that even in the middle of\nthe lake there was someone or something disturbing him.\nWhen he opened his eyes, he saw a boat heading straight\ntowards him. He shouted, “Steer your boat away, or else you will\nhit my boat.” But the other boat kept coming straight at him\nand was just a few feet away. He yelled again but nothing\nchanged and so the incoming boat hit the monk’s boat. Now he\nwas furious. He screamed, “Who are you, and why have you hit\nmy boat in the middle of this vast lake?” There was no answer.\nThis made the young monk even angrier.\nHe stood up to see who was in the other boat and to his\nsurprise, he found that there was no one in the boat.\nThe boat had probably drifted along in the breeze and had\nbumped into the monk’s boat. The monk found his anger\ndissipating. It was just an empty boat! There was no one to get\nangry at!\nAt that moment he remembered his mentors’ question, “Do\nyou know what is really making you angry?” And then\nwondered, “It’s not other people, situations, or circumstances.\nIt’s not the empty boat, but my reaction to it that causes my\n\nanger. All the people or situations that make me upset and\nangry are just like the empty boat. They don’t have the power to\nmake me angry without my own reaction.”\nThe monk then rowed the boat back to the shore. He\nreturned to the monastery and started meditating along with\nthe other monks. There were still noises and disturbances\naround, but the monk treated them as the “empty boat” and\ncontinued to meditate peacefully. When the elder monk saw the\ndifference, he simply said to the young monk, “I see that you\nhave found what is really making you angry and overcome\nthat.”\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nchapter 3\nWHY DO WE EVEN THINK?\n“I think and think and think, I’ve thought myself\nout of happiness one million times, but never once\ninto it.” — Jonathan Safran Foer\nWe as humans have evolved to develop a sophisticated ability to\nrationalize, analyze, and think because it simply helped us\nsurvive. Our minds do an incredible job to keep us alive, but it\ndoes not help us thrive. It is concerned solely with our safety\nand survival, but not our fulfillment or joy.\nThe mind’s job is to alert us of potential dangers in our\nenvironment that may threaten our lives. It does its job so well\nthat not only will it scan our immediate surroundings for\nthreats, but it will even reference our backlog of past\nexperiences to create hypothetical scenarios and predict what it\nthinks could be future potential dangers based on our\nmemories.\nNone of this is wrong by any means. The mind is simply\ndoing what it was designed to do. When we don’t understand\nthat its only duty is to help us survive, then we will get angry\nand frustrated with it. All conflict is derived from an innocent\n\nmisunderstanding. Our mind’s duty is to keep us alive. Our\nconsciousness’s duty is to help us feel fulfilled. Your soul is the\nreason why you’re even on this journey in the first place — to\nfind peace, love, and joy for yourself.\nYour mind has done an amazing job at what it was made to\ndo, but now you may relieve it of its job because we no longer\nlive in the wild where death could be right around the corner in\na bush. If we keep using our minds, we will constantly stay in a\nstate of fight or flight, anxiety, fear, frustration, depression,\nanger, resentment, and all negative emotions because the mind\nthinks everything is a threat to our very existence. If you want\nto be free, happy, peaceful, and full of love, then you will need to\nlet go of listening only to your mind and go beyond it by tuning\ninto something much greater that will help you not just to\nsurvive, but to thrive.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nchapter 4\nTHOUGHTS VS. THINKING\n“Stop thinking and end your problems.”\n― Lao Tzu\nThoughts are the energetic, mental raw materials from which\nwe use to create everything in the world. We can’t experience\nanything without thought. It’s important to know that\nthoughts are a noun and aren’t something that we do, but\nsomething we have. A thought takes no effort or force on our\nend, and it is something that just happens. We also cannot\ncontrol what thoughts pop into our minds. The source of\nthoughts comes from something that is beyond our minds —\nthe Universe, if you will.\nThinking, on the other hand, is the act of thinking about our\nthoughts. This takes a significant amount of energy, effort, and\nwillpower (which is a finite resource). Thinking is actively\nengaging with the thoughts in your mind. You don’t have to\nengage with each thought in your mind, but when you do, that\nis thinking.\nThinking is the root cause of all our psychological suffering.\n\nNow you might be wondering, where do positive thoughts fit\ninto the picture? Positive thoughts, or thoughts that feel good,\nare not a result of thinking. They are, instead, generated by our\nnatural state of peace, love, and joy. They are a byproduct of a\nstate of being, not a state of thinking. We will go into depth\nabout this in the next chapter.\nFor now, let’s do a quick thought experiment.\nI’ll ask you a question and all you need to do is to be aware of\nwhat you’re experiencing, and we’ll review what happened\nafter.\nWhat is the dream amount of money you want to be making\na year?\nPause here and wait for an answer to surface.\nGive yourself about 30-60 seconds to think about your\nanswer of how much money you want to be making in a year.\nDon’t move on to the next step until you’ve had a decently\nsized train of thought about how much you want to make.\nNow take that amount and multiply that by 5.\nWhat do you think about this new dream goal for your\nincome when we multiplied it by 5?\nTake at least another 30-60 seconds to become aware of how\nyou’re feeling when you think about that and see what other\nthinking comes up for you as you feel your emotions.\nDon’t move on until you’ve done the above.\nOkay, let’s bring it back in and review what happened.\nAfter I asked the first question of what is the dream amount\nof money you want to be making per year, within a few seconds\n\nan answer popped up in your mind. That is a thought. Notice\nhow quickly and effortlessly that came to you.\nAfter an answer popped into your mind, I asked you to think\nabout your answer. What happened once I asked you to think\nabout your answer?\nIf you’re like most people, you probably went on a wild\nrollercoaster once you began thinking about the thought.\nYou might have been thinking how there’s no way you can\nmake that much, no one in your family is making that much\nmoney, you don’t know how to make that much, it’s stupid to\nwant that much money or that it makes you greedy.\nNotice how you felt when you were thinking about those\nthoughts.\nMost likely it didn’t feel that great, but that is okay, and I’ll\nshow you what you can do about it soon.\nThis is a prime example of thoughts versus thinking.\nIf I ask you a question, you will 100% have a thought that\npops into your mind.\nThoughts are not inherently bad. Remember that they are\nthe energetic mental raw materials from which we create in the\nworld.\nThe moment we think about our thoughts is when we begin\nto get taken on an emotional rollercoaster. When we think\nabout our thoughts, we begin to judge and criticize the\nthoughts and experience all sorts of internal emotional turmoil.\nWhen I asked you how much you wanted to make, you had a\nthought about the amount. That thought was neutral and\ndidn’t cause any emotional toil. In fact, you might have felt\n\nexpansive and excited. It was only when you began thinking\nabout that thought of how much you wanted to make which is\nwhat caused the self-doubt, unworthiness, anxiety, anger, guilt,\nor any other emotion you may have experienced.\nThis is what I mean by thinking is the root of all of our\nsuffering. Having the initial thought of how much you wanted\nto make didn’t cause any suffering until you began thinking\nabout the thought of how much you wanted to make.\nIt is not necessary to think about our thoughts or to judge\nthem. It does us no good to do so. We may think that thinking is\nhelping us, but all it’s really doing is causing us to feel all of\nthese negative, unwanted emotions and making us create\nreasons as to why we can’t do it or why we shouldn’t want it.\nThe only thing that was useful and helpful was the initial\nthought that popped into your mind when I first asked how\nmuch you wanted to make. All of the thinking that happened\nafter was destructive and unhelpful.\nThoughts create. Thinking destroys.\nThe reason thinking destroys is because as soon as we begin\nto think about the thoughts, we cast our own limiting beliefs,\njudgements, criticisms, programming, and conditioning onto\nthe thought, thinking of infinite reasons as to why we can’t do it\nand why we can’t have it.\nWithout thinking, we prevent all negative programming and\njudgements from tarnishing the initial thought of what you\nwant to create.\nIf I asked you what are some ways you could make the\namount of money you want, if you sat there long enough, you’ll\n\nexperience the same phenomenon of having random thoughts\npop into your head of ways you could make it happen.\nThese are thoughts of creation. Thoughts are inherently\ninfinite, expansive, and energetically positive. You’ll know you\nare having thoughts from the divine when you feel positive\nemotions, feel lighter, and alive.\nAs soon as you begin thinking about those thoughts of the\nways you can make the money you want, you’ll immediately\nfeel heavy, restricted, limited, along with a whole onslaught of\nnegative emotions. This is how you’ll know if you’re thinking.\nI use my feelings as an internal radar that tells me whether\nI’m getting direct downloads of thoughts from the Universe or\nif I’m in my head thinking about my thoughts.\nYou can only ever feel what you’re thinking, so feelings and\nemotions are like an intuitive internal dashboard which tells me\nif I’m thinking too much or not.\nIf I’m having a lot of negative emotions, I know that I’m\nthinking too much. This is another example of how we’re\nnaturally built for success.\nBelow is a chart that compares Thinking vs. Thoughts to\nhelp you identify which one is which within your mind:\nThoughts vs. Thinking Chart\nAttribute\nThought\nThinking\nSource\nUniverse\nEgo\nWeight\nLight\nHeavy\nEnergy\nExpansive\nRestrictive\n\nAttribute\nThought\nThinking\nNature\nInfinite\nLimited\nQuality\nCreative\nDestructive\nCharge\nPositive\nNegative\nEssence\nDivine\nMortal\nFeeling\nAlive\nStressful\nEmotion\nLove\nFear\nBelief\nInfinite Possibilities\nConfining\nSense\nWholeness\nSeparateness\nEffort\nEffortless\nLaborious\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nchapter 5\nIF WE CAN ONLY FEEL WHAT\nWE’RE THINKING, DON’T WE\nNEED TO THINK POSITIVELY TO\nFEEL THAT WAY?\n“We are ever only one thought away from peace,\nlove, and joy — which come from a state of no\nthought.”\n― Dicken Bettinger\nThere is a caveat that I haven’t mentioned yet to the principle\nthat we can only feel what we’re thinking. The more accurate\nway of describing it is that we can only ever feel negative\nemotions when we are thinking.\nThe goal isn’t necessarily to completely stop feeling negative\nemotions. Some of the negative emotions can be helpful, such\nas feeling fearful when deciding to walk down a dark alley alone\nwith no one else in sight.\nThese negative emotions are only helpful to us in terms of\nsurvival, but if we don’t constantly encounter life or death\n\nsituations, negative emotions are more unhelpful than helpful\nfor most of us.\nWe’re going to be moving forward with the context that\nwe’re not struggling for physical survival, so we’ll be using the\ncontext that negative emotions are not necessary most of the\ntime.\nWhen I mention that we can only ever feel what we’re\nthinking, most people assume that we must think positive to\nfeel positive emotions.\nInstead of convincing you if this is true or not, let’s do\nanother thought experiment so you can experience the truth\nfor yourself.\nRecall a time when you felt the most joy and love you’ve ever\nfelt in your life and feel the feelings that you felt at that time as\nmuch as you can for at least 30 seconds.\nWhat kinds of thoughts were going through your mind at\nthat peak moment when you felt the most joy and love? (I’m not\nasking what you were doing at the time, but what thoughts\nwere going through your head at that exact moment.)\nFor many people that answer this, they realize that they\ndidn’t have any thoughts during that exact moment. For others,\nthey say that the thought was that they were so grateful or\nhappy.\nFor those that answered that they had the thought that they\nwere grateful, did you feel that joy and love before you had that\nthought or after?\nTake 10-15 seconds to answer that question before moving\non.\n\nWhat insights and epiphanies did you have?\nWhat’s crazy is that most people didn’t have any thoughts\ngoing through their mind when they felt the happiest and the\nmost amount of love in their lives. For those that had the\nthought that they were grateful, they felt that way before\nhaving that thought.\nIf they had that thought, it happened after they felt the\nfeelings, so the thought could not have produced the feeling.\nThis brings us to another truth: you do not have to have\nthoughts or think to feel positive emotions.\nThe beautiful part about truth is that it needs no\njustification because it can be experienced right here right now.\nIt doesn’t need to be proven or rationalized to you and you\nexperienced this truth firsthand by the experiment we just did.\nHere’s why we don’t need to have thoughts or think to feel\npositive emotions like joy and love.\nOur natural state of being IS joy, love, ecstasy, freedom, and\ngratitude. This may be hard to believe because if it’s natural,\nwhy don’t we feel that way all the time? I’ll answer this in a bit.\nIf we want to see the natural state of anything, one of the\nbest ways is to look at nature and the state of it in its infancy\n(before it is affected and conditioned by its environment).\nFor example, let’s look at the natural state of a baby. What is\na baby’s natural and default state (assuming the baby wasn’t\nabused, neglected, or had any physical issues)? Are babies\nnaturally stressed, anxious, fearful, and self-conscious? Or are\nthey naturally in a state of bliss, happiness, and love?\n\nOur natural state of being is joy, love, and peace. Therefore,\nany thinking that we do will only take us away from those\nnatural states of being, which is why whenever we feel\nextremely stressed, we are having a LOT of thinking going on.\nThe strength of the negative emotion we feel is in direct\nproportion to how much thinking we are doing in the moment.\nOn the other hand, the intensity of the positive emotion we\nfeel is inversely proportional to the amount of thinking we are\ndoing in the moment. In other words, the less thinking we have\ngoing on, the stronger the positive emotion we feel in the\npresent.\nTo see the truth in this, recall a few other memories you had\nwhen you were extremely stressed and anxious and see how\nmuch thinking was going on at the time.\nTake about 1-2 minutes to do this.\nThen recall a few memories where you were at your happiest\nor felt the most joy and love and see how much thinking you\nhad going on at that time.\nTake another 1-2 minutes to do this before moving on to\nreally experience and internalize the truth of what you see.\nAn analogy that my coach taught me that helped crystallize\nthis concept was to imagine our mind has a speedometer (like\nin a car), but instead of miles per hour, it is thoughts per\nminute. The more thinking we have going on, the higher the\n“thought-o-meter” goes, and if we have enough thinking going\non, it’ll go into the red zone. This is when we feel extremely\nstressed, burned out, frustrated, and angry.\nIt is not the content of our thinking that causes us stress, but\nthat we are thinking, period. The amount of thinking we have\n\ngoing on is directly correlated to the magnitude of stress and\nnegative emotions we are experiencing at any given moment.\nWhen you’re experiencing a lot of frustration, stress, anxiety, or\nany negative emotions, just know that it is because you’re\nthinking, and the intensity of those emotions is directly\ncorrelated to how much thinking is going on.\nTherefore, it’s not WHAT we’re thinking about that is\ncausing us suffering, but THAT we are thinking.\nTo summarize, we do not have to try to “think positive” to\nexperience love, joy, bliss, and any positive emotions we want\nbecause it is our natural state to feel those emotions. The only\ntimes we don’t naturally feel these emotions is when we begin\nto think about the thoughts we’re having, thus blocking the\ndirect connection to Infinite Intelligence and we feel stressed,\nanxious, depressed, and fearful. It is not about the content of\nour thinking, but that we’re thinking, which is the root cause of\nour suffering. The intensity of the negative emotions is directly\ncorrelated to the amount of thinking we have going on in the\npresent. The less thinking we have, the more space we create for\npositive emotions to naturally surface.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nchapter 6\nHOW THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE IS\nCREATED -THE THREE\nPRINCIPLES\n“If the only thing people learned was not to be\nafraid of their experience, that alone would\nchange the world.”\n― Sydney Banks\nAt its fundamental level, the human experience is created by\nthese three principles: Universal Mind, Consciousness, and\nThought. These three principles work together to allow us to\nexperience everything we do in life and if one of the three is\nmissing, we wouldn’t be able to experience anything. These\nprinciples were first discovered by Sydney Banks and now I have\nthe humbling privilege to share them with you.\nUnderstanding these three principles enables us to know\nhow we can alleviate ourselves from our suffering, but also\nallows us to create from Source.\nUniversal Mind\n\nUniversal Mind is the Intelligence behind all living things. It\nis the life force and energy that is in all things. It is how an\nacorn knows how to grow into a tree, how the planets know\nhow to stay in orbit, and how our bodies know how to heal itself\nwhen we get a cut. It’s how our bodies know how to self-\nregulate and keep us alive without us having to manually do\neverything like breathing and beating our heart. The\nIntelligence that knows how to do all of this and is in all things\nis called the Universal Mind. Many people call this God, Infinite\nIntelligence, the Quantum Field, Source, and other names. This\nis where Thoughts come from as well as everything else in the\nUniverse. All things are connected by Universal Mind. There is\nno separation between anything, and any time there seems to\nbe separation between things, it is merely an illusion of our\nthinking. When we are connected to Universal Mind, we feel\nwhole, fulfilled, filled with love, joy, peace, and inspiration. It is\nonly when we begin thinking (believing the illusion or ego) that\nwe block this flow of Universal Mind and begin to feel separated,\nfrustrated, lonely, angry, resentful, sad, depressed, and fearful.\nUniversal Consciousness\nUniversal Consciousness is the collective consciousness of all\nthings. It is what allows us to be aware that we exist and aware\nof our thoughts. Without Universal Consciousness, we wouldn’t\nbe able to experience anything. Our five senses would have no\nuse because there’s nothing to be aware of. This is what brings\nthings to life and makes them perceivable to us.\nUniversal Thought\nUniversal Thought is the raw material of the Universe from\nwhich we can create from. It is our ability to think and create\nform from the energy of the Universal Mind.\n\nIt’s the object we can perceive through Consciousness.\nWithout Thought, we would have nothing to be aware of.\nThought is like the DVD that contains all the information for us\nto be able to watch the movie on the TV. The TV and DVD player\nis like Consciousness — it allows us to have a mechanism to\nbring the information on the DVD to life for us to be able to\nwatch and experience the movie. The electricity that’s needed\nto power the DVD player and TV is like Universal Mind in the\nsense that it is the invisible energy/force that connects and\npowers all things. It is the Source from which everything can\nwork and function.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nchapter 7\nIF THINKING IS THE ROOT\nCAUSE OF OUR SUFFERING, HOW\nDO WE STOP THINKING?\n“A crowded mind leaves no space for a peaceful\nheart.”\n― Christine Evangelou\nHeaven and Hell: A Zen Parable\nA tough, brawny samurai once approached a Zen master who\nwas deep in meditation. Impatient and discourteous, the\nsamurai demanded in his husky voice so accustomed to forceful\nyelling, “Tell me the nature of heaven and hell.”\nThe Zen master opened his eyes, looked the samurai in the\nface, and replied with a certain scorn, “Why should I answer to\na shabby, disgusting, despondent slob like you? A worm like\nyou, do you think I should tell you anything? I can’t stand you.\nGet out of my sight. I have no time for silly questions.”\nThe samurai could not bear these insults. Consumed by rage,\nhe drew his sword and raised it to sever the master’s head at\n\nonce.\nLooking straight into the samurai’s eyes, the Zen master\ntenderly declared, “That’s hell.”\nThe samurai froze. He immediately understood that anger\nhad him in its grip. His mind had just created his own hell —\none filled with resentment, hatred, self-defense, and fury. He\nrealized that he was so deep in his torment that he was ready to\nkill somebody.\nThe samurai’s eyes filled with tears. Setting his sword aside,\nhe put his palms together and obsequiously bowed in gratitude\nfor this insight.\nThe Zen master gently acknowledged with a delicate smile,\n“And that’s heaven.”\nIt’s not possible to just entirely stop thinking, but what we\ncan do is reduce the time we spend thinking so that it gets\nsmaller and smaller each day that passes. Eventually we can get\nto the point where we spend most of our day not caught up in\nour thinking and live in a blissful state most of the time.\nWhen we say that we want to stop thinking, many people\nassume that we are trying to stop all thoughts in general. This\nisn’t what we’re trying to do. Now that you know the difference\nbetween thoughts and thinking, we are working on allowing\nthoughts to come and flow through us while we minimize the\nthinking about those thoughts that emerge.\nThe most interesting and almost paradoxical thing about\nstopping our thinking is that we don’t have to do anything to\nminimize it other than to be aware of it. By us becoming aware\nthat we are thinking and that it is the root cause of all our\nsuffering, it automatically makes us conscious to that fact and\n\nwe become detached to it, allowing it to settle and pass. This\ntakes almost no effort and is done through pure presence in the\nmoment.\nHere’s an analogy from one of my mentors that illustrates\nthis concept:\nImagine I give you a bowl of cloudy, dirty, murky water. If I\nasked you, how you would make the water clear, how would\nyou do it?\nTake 15 seconds to see what answers you come up with\nbefore moving on.\nMost people say something along the lines of filtering the\nwater or even boiling it. What most people don’t realize is that if\nwe let the bowl of dirty water sit for a period of time, we can see\nthat the dirt begins to settle on its own in the water and after a\nwhile, the water becomes clear on its own.\nThis is how our minds also work. If we let our thinking sit\nwithout disturbing it by trying to “filter” or “boil” it, the\nthinking will settle down on its own and our minds will become\nfree from thinking. The natural state of water is clear, and the\nnatural state of our minds is also clear, if we do not disturb it.\nIf life begins to feel unclear, disorganized, stressful and\nyou’re not sure what to do next, you now know that it’s only\nbecause your thinking is stirring up the dirt, making your mind\ncloudy and difficult to\nsee ahead. You can use this as an indicator to help you realize\nthat you’re thinking way too much.\nOnce we become aware of the fact that we are only feeling\nwhat we’re thinking and that thinking is the root cause of our\nunpleasant experience, we see it for what it truly is. Then we\n\nallow it to settle by giving it space, and slowly we will see how\nwe begin to have a clear mind again.\nYou can also compare thinking to quicksand. The more that\nwe fight our thinking, the more it amplifies the negative\nemotions and the worse it gets. The same is true for quicksand.\nIf we’re in quicksand, the way out isn’t to fight it. If we panic\nand frantically try to fight it, it only makes things worse by\ntightening the grip it has on us and pulling us under faster. The\nonly way out is to stop struggling and allowing the natural\nbuoyancy of your body to take over to bring you back up to the\nsurface with ease. The only way to break free from our thinking\nis to let go and trust that our natural inner wisdom will guide\nus back to clarity and peace like it always has.\nIf you find yourself fluctuating between thinking and non-\nthinking, know that it is completely okay and quite normal.\nThere is no way that we can remain in a state of non-thinking\nevery second of every day and if we try to make that a goal, we\nwill cause ourselves to suffer by forcing ourselves back into\nthinking again.\nWe are spiritual, infinite beings having a physical, finite\nexperience. Because of this, we are literally a living gateway\nbetween the human and the divine, so we will naturally\noscillate between the two states of feeling anxious/stressed and\njoyful/peaceful. We cannot control or prevent the oscillation\nbetween thinking and non-thinking, but we can minimize the\ntime spent in thinking and thus creating more moments where\nwe do feel joyful, peaceful, passionate, and full of love.\nAlthough not being able to control when we begin to think\ncan seem like we are cursed with an inevitable fate, it is not\nsomething to worry about because we can always return to the\n\nstate of nonthinking. It is just a part of our beautiful human\nexperience.\nWhat can give us true peace is knowing that we always have\nthis state of pure peace, love, and fulfillment underneath any\nthinking that we may ever have at any given moment. That\nbeautiful state we always want is something we can never lose,\nbut only forget. But just because we can forget it doesn’t mean\nit’s not there. Just like when it becomes night and the sun sets,\nwe know that the sun is always there, we just can’t see it. If we\nthought when the sun sets that it may never come back, then\nunderstandably we will have a lot of anxious and fearful\nthoughts. The same is true for our state of being.\nWe are ever really one moment away from remembering\nthat we always have that infinite well of clarity, love, joy,\npeace, and fulfillment. We will forget sometimes, but when we\ndo remember and realize that we are caught up in our thinking\nwhen we experience negative emotions, that alone will allow us\nto return back home to our natural beautiful state. All we have\nto do is remember it, know that this is just our thinking, and\nhave peace knowing that the sun is not gone forever and that it\nwill rise again soon enough. Having that understanding will\nallow us to also appreciate the nighttime for its existence and\nrole in the Universe. From that we can see how it is meant to be\na part of our human experience and begin to cherish its beauty\nas much as the sun.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nchapter 8\nHOW CAN WE POSSIBLY THRIVE\nIN THE WORLD WITHOUT\nTHINKING?\n“Anxiety is thought without control. Flow is\ncontrol without thought.”\n― James Clear\nHere’s a question that will guide you to an insight about this\nquestion:\nWhat thoughts are going through your head when you’re\ndoing your absolute best work where you’re fully captivated\nand entranced by what you’re doing in the moment?\nTake about 15 seconds to wait for an answer to pop up before\nmoving on.\nIf you still haven’t had the insight or epiphany from the\nanswer, here’s another question that may point you in the right\ndirection:\nWhen you are loving what you do so much and are\ncompletely engrossed in it that you lose all sense of time and\n\nspace (aka when you’re in a state of complete flow), what\nthoughts are going through your mind as you’re in the state of\nflow in the moment?\nPause here and wait for the answer to arise (give it about 30-\n60 seconds for the insight to come in).\nWhen you are doing your best work and are in a total state of\nflow, where there is no separation between you or the work you\nare doing, you are having no thoughts in the moment. And if\nyou are having thoughts, it’s just flowing right through you\nwithout you having to think about it. In other words, the state\nof peak performance for humans can be described as the state\nof non-thinking. It may seem crazy, but we do our best work\nwhen we aren’t thinking, and you just proved it with your own\nexperience.\nHere’s another example that will help illuminate the truth of\nthis topic. When professional or even Olympic athletes are\ncompeting, do you think they are thinking and overanalyzing\nevery single thing that’s happening during the game? What\nthoughts or thinking do you think is going on during the\ncompetition for them? The highest performing athletes will\ndescribe when they are in their peak state that they are in “the\nzone”. This “zone” is the state of flow or the state of non-\nthinking.\nIn Japanese culture, they have a beautiful word to describe\nthis phenomenon: mushin.\nHere is the definition from Shotokantimes:\n“Mushin is achieved when [the] mind is free of random\nthoughts, free of anger, free of fear, and particularly free of ego.\nIt applies during combat, and or other facets of life. When\nmushin is achieved during combat there is an absence of loose\n\nor rambling thoughts. It leaves the practitioner free to act and\nreact without hesitation. He reacts according to all of the study\nand training that has brought the karateka to this point. Relying\non, not what you think should be your next move, but on what\nyour trained, instinctive, subconscious reaction directs you to\ndo.”\nAfter practice, thinking hinders the performance of athletes\nand the same is true for everyone. We only hesitate, are\nreluctant, have doubts, insecurities, and fears only when we\nbegin thinking and over-analyzing. We function and perform\nour best and embody our full potential the moment we enter a\nstate of non-thinking. Without thinking, we are free from\nlimitations of the ego and are able to create the most incredible\nthings in the world. I am not asking you to adopt this belief, but\nto try it and experience it for yourself so that you gain the\ninsight to make it your own.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nchapter 9\nIF WE STOP THINKING, WHAT\nDO WE DO ABOUT OUR GOALS,\nDREAMS & AMBITIONS?\n“There are no limitations to the mind except those\nwe acknowledge.”\n― Napoleon Hill\nI think, therefore I suffer.\nWhen I finally understood that thinking was the root cause of\nall of my suffering, I was jumping up and down, exhilarated,\nrelieved and grateful for discovering the true reason for\neverything negative I’ve experienced in my life. This ecstasy\nwas short-lived though because soon after the exuberance\nsettled, the next thoughts popped into my mind:\nIf thinking is the root cause of all my suffering and I just stop\nthinking, how do I live my life now? What about all of my goals,\ndreams, and ambitions? Do I stop wanting things in life? Will I\njust devolve into a couch potato and not do anything with my\nlife anymore?\n\nIn case you were wondering, yes, I am telepathic and yes, I\ncan read your mind. Just kidding, but if you are wondering how\nI wrote the exact or very similar questions and know what\nthoughts you most likely have right now, it’s because I am\nhuman also, contrary to popular belief. All of us are going\nthrough similar journeys of awakening to our True Selves, so\nrest assured that many people are having the exact same\nthoughts you are having right now as you come to see your true\nmagnificence.\nNow back to the question of what we do about our goals,\ndreams, and ambitions if we stop thinking. As I pondered on\nthese questions, an incredible amount of fear and anxiety began\nto surface because I thought that I would have to give all of it up\nand become a monk in the middle of the mountains.\nI was definitely not ready to do that. As much as I wish I\nwere that enlightened and detached from my life, I genuinely\nenjoyed being in the world, experiencing the fullness of life\nwith other people, even if a large portion of my life was filled\nwith suffering.\nHere’s what I’ve discovered about what to do with our goals\nand dreams with this new understanding. As we’ve mentioned\nin previous chapters, there’s a difference between thoughts\nversus thinking. The source of thoughts and the source of\nthinking are different, and the source is what will dictate\nwhether it causes suffering or not.\nSimilarly, where our goals and dreams come from will\ndetermine whether we feel great about pursuing them or not.\nLike everything in this world, there is nothing inherently good\nor bad, only our thinking makes it so. Goals, dreams, and\nambitions are not good or bad, so it’s not really an either-or\nsituation, but more about where those goals are coming from.\n\nThere are two sources of goals: goals created out of\ninspiration and goals created out of desperation.\nWhen goals are created out of desperation, we feel a large\nsense of scarcity and urgency. It feels heavy, like a burden, we\nmay even feel daunted by the colossal task we’ve just\ncommitted ourselves to, imposter syndrome and self-doubt\nbegin to manifest, and we always feel like we never have enough\ntime for anything. We go about our life frantically, desperately\nsearching for answers and ways that we can accomplish our\ngoal faster, always looking externally, never feeling enough or\nthat we can ever get enough. Worst of all, if we happen to\naccomplish our goal, within a few hours or days afterwards, all\nof those same feelings of lack begin to resurface. We begin not\nfeeling content with what we have done, unable to savor our\naccomplishments and because what we did never feels like it’s\nenough, we feel that same way about ourselves. Not knowing\nwhat else to do, we look around for guidance externally to see\nwhat others are doing and see they’re continuing to do the same\nthing. Thus, we go ahead and proceed to set another goal out of\ndesperation in an attempt to escape all of the negative feelings\ngnawing away at our soul. When we dig a little deeper into\nthese types of goals we set, they are all typically “means goals”\nand not “end goals”. In other words, the goals we set in this state\nof desperation are all a means to an end. There’s always a reason\nwe want to accomplish the goal and it’s always for something\nelse. For example, we want to create a multi-million-dollar\nbusiness because we want financial freedom, or we want to quit\nour job so that we can escape the stress and anxiety that comes\nfrom it. We feel like we HAVE to do these things instead of\nWANT to. Goals created from desperation are typically\n“realistic” and created from analyzing our past and what we\nthink to be “plausible” in the moment. It feels very confining\n\nand limiting. Although these types of goals and dreams may\nexcite us in the moment, as soon as we begin to try to create it,\nwe feel a lack, and we are desperate to bring the dream to life.\nParadoxically, if we do end up achieving a goal created out of\ndesperation, we end up feeling even more empty than we did\nbefore it. The next “logical” thing we tend to do is to set an even\nbigger goal out of even greater desperation to hopefully make us\nfeel whole inside.\nThis is how most of us set our goals and how we live our\nlives. I’m also not saying this to criticize or judge at all, but to\nreveal the reality of it. The only reason why I was able to\ndescribe it in painful and excruciating detail was because that\nwas my life.\nHere’s the good news: it’s not your fault that you set goals\nthat way if you are and there’s a way out. It’s through creating\ngoals and dreams out of inspiration instead of desperation.\nWhen we create goals out of inspiration versus desperation,\nit is a completely different story. In this state, we are creating\nbecause we feel deeply moved, inspired, and expansive. It feels\nlike a calling rather than an obligation. It is like there’s a\npowerful force of life coming from within us, wanting to be\nexpressed through us to be made manifested into the physical\nworld. This is why painters paint, why dancers dance, why\nwriters write and why singers sing, even if they never get paid\nor make a living from it. We feel pulled by a force to create\nsomething. We gravitate towards it. We feel compelled to do it.\nWhen we feel like this, we are creating from a place of\nabundance instead of lack.\nMost surprising of all is that in this state, we are creating not\nfor any reason at all, other than because we simply want to. We\ndon’t create because we feel like we HAVE to. We create because\n\nwe simply want to and there’s no other reason. We aren’t\ncreating these goals so that we can do something else or use it\nas a means to get something else we want. This creating comes\nfrom a place of wholeness and abundance. It’s an overflowing of\nlove and joy for life. This is the reason why most of us want or\nhave kids. It’s not so that we can milk our kids for their money\nonce they’re old enough to work and hopefully use them as a\nretirement plan. We want to have kids because we want to share\nthe abundance of what we have with them, and it comes from a\nplace of sharing what we have lots of versus trying to get\nsomething out of them.\nThis feeling of deep inspiration is incredibly difficult to\ndescribe because it does not come from this world. It really\ndoesn’t come from us, but through us from something greater\nthan us. I like to call this feeling divine inspiration because the\nideas and vision we have of what we want to create seem to be\nfar bigger than we could have possibly imagined or come up\nwith ourselves. Since divine inspiration doesn’t come from us\nbut from something greater, it doesn’t analyze or rely on past\ndata or what you or anyone in the world has already\naccomplished. Divine inspiration is what happens when\ngroundbreaking creations and inventions are created that\nseemed to be impossible not too long ago. It knows no\nboundaries, limits, or constraints. It is an incredibly expansive\nforce that energizes and lifts us, making us feel like we’re “high”\non life. In this state, we feel whole, complete, filled with\nunconditional love, joy, and peace. We don’t analyze, compare,\ncriticize, judge, or rationalize anything, but instead we truly\nlive, love, share, give, create, grow, and nourish. It really is one\nof the greatest feelings we can experience, and it is truly a gift\nthat we can experience the divine as humans (and it’s because\nwe’re from the same source).\n\nEveryone has experienced this deep feeling and desire to\ncreate something marvelous in the world that’s out of pure\ninspiration and not desperation. Before moving on to the next\nparagraph, I encourage you to test this theory. Pause here and\nspend a few minutes thinking about times in your life where\nyou felt an overwhelming feeling and desire to create\nsomething magnificent because you felt deeply inspired and\ncalled to. It doesn’t matter if you actually created it or not, but\njust think of a time where you felt that feeling to create out of\ninspiration.\nIsn’t that just one of the most amazing feelings in the entire\nworld? Most of us feel this divine inspiration, but then suppress\nit as soon as we begin thinking about doing it. We begin to think\nourselves into doubt, rationalize why we can’t do it, tell\nourselves that it is unrealistic, how we should focus on more\nimportant things, and that we’re not good enough to do it. As\nsoon as we begin to think about the thought of us wanting to\ncreate, it completely shuts off the source of that inspiration and\nwe go back to living life as usual. When we cut off that source,\nwe also cut off the feelings of abundance, exuberance, ecstasy,\njoy, pure unconditional love, and go back to the feelings of\ndoubt, anxiety, frustration, sadness, and feel confined, stuck,\nand frustrated with our lives.\nWe can only ever follow one calling at a time, either\ninspiration or desperation in the present moment. The two\ncannot coexist at the same time, but we can fluctuate between\nthe two depending on how much thinking is going on.\nWhen we stop thinking, we don’t stop having goals and\ndreams, we actually fall back into our true nature and begin to\ncreate goals and dreams out of inspiration versus desperation.\nWe begin to allow thoughts from the Universe to come into our\n\nmind that lead us to divine inspiration to create something that\nhas never been created before in the world. When we follow\ndivine inspiration, we feel alive, whole, joy, love, peace, and\nfulfillment.\nSo how can we tell when a goal or dream is created out of\ninspiration or desperation?\nA simple way to know if a goal or dream is created out of\ninspiration is to remember the distinction between thoughts\nand thinking. Goals and dreams that come in the form of\nthought are created out of inspiration. Goals and dreams that\ncome from thinking are created out of desperation.\nTypically, when we think, we’ll analyze, judge, criticize,\nrationalize, and use our past to try to create our new goals, but\nthis form of creating goals feels extremely restricting and\nlimiting. We don’t typically feel good when creating these types\nof goals and when we’re pursuing them, we do not feel great\neither, since it’s all out of desperation.\nAnother way to identify the two is to sense how you feel\nenergetically. Goals and dreams created out of desperation will\nfeel very heavy, draining, confining, and empty. We tend to feel\na lot of scarcity, fear, and stress, like we HAVE to do it or that we\nare obligated to. With these types of goals, it seems like if we do\nnot accomplish it, that there will be dire consequences, hence\nthe high pressure and stakes (I’m sure you can see now how this\ncan create the feeling of desperation). Moreover, we feel like\nwe’re trying to accomplish these goals to escape our current\nsituation and get out of something. Our goals created in this\nstate are typically means goals, meaning that we want to\nachieve these goals so that we can do something else\nafterwards, such as having the goal to quit our job. Most likely\nyou’ll have this goal because you want to go do something you\n\nactually enjoy, but you can see how the goal of quitting your job\nis just a means goal for you to go do something else. Or having a\ngoal of making $1 million is typically set because you want to\nhave financial freedom and go travel the world. These goals are\nalways a means to an end and not the end itself. There’s always\na reason that we want to accomplish these goals and it makes us\nfeel very empty inside.\nI want to emphasize that none of these goals are inherently\nbad or that we shouldn’t have goals of wanting to make money\nor quitting our jobs. If those goals are created from inspiration,\nthat is completely different. It just depends on the source of the\ngoals and not necessarily the goal itself. This is an important\ndistinction to make, otherwise you’ll spend most of your time\ndebating and stressing yourself out over if this is the right goal\nfor you or not.\nThere is no right or wrong goal, only goals created from\ninspiration or desperation. It just depends on how you want to\nfeel inside and when you’re aware of these two types of goals\nand how they manifest, then you’ll be able to feel blissful as you\ngo about creating amazing things in your life.\nOn the other hand, goals and dreams created out of\ninspiration (which comes from thought) feel very light,\nenergizing, uplifting, and expansive. We tend to feel excited,\njoyful, and most importantly, inspired. We don’t feel like we\nHAVE to create it, but that we WANT to. Instead of feeling like\nyou NEED to do this, you feel inspired to. There is virtually no\npressure because we’re not trying to get out of something or\nescape our current situation by accomplishing this goal. There\nis no scarcity or urgency because we don’t feel like we’re\ncreating from a place of lack, but instead from a place of\nabundance and we just want to share it with the world. Since\n\nit’s coming from inspiration, we are not doing it to get\nsomething out of it so that we can do something else. It’s not a\nmeans goal, but simply an end in and of itself. There is no\n“reason” we need to create it. We are not creating so that we can\nfeel whole, but we are creating because we feel whole and want\nto give from that place, not expecting anything from it.\nI’m sure you can see the stark difference between the two\nnow and that you can tell which type your goals currently fall\nunder. If most of your goals fall under the category of\ndesperation, don’t worry because most people have goals\ncreated from desperation, including myself before I knew a\nbetter way.\nSo how do we create goals and dreams out of inspiration\nversus desperation?\nCreating goals and dreams from divine inspiration isn’t\nsomething you have to try to do. We naturally have thoughts of\ninfinite inspiration all the time. If you look at children, they\nnaturally have the wildest dreams and imaginations of what\nthey want to do. It almost doesn’t even register in their minds\nthat they can’t do something most of the time. The only\ndifference between us and children is that we have learned to\nshut down all these thoughts of inspiration which contain our\ndreams, hopes, and goals that we truly want to see manifested\nin the world. Our minds are filled more with reasons of why we\ncan’t than thoughts of what we want to create.\nWe innately have an infinite flow of inspiration that comes\nthrough us, but we block that flow as soon as we begin thinking\nabout the thoughts we have, which causes self-doubt, self-\nsabotage, and anxiety. Think of the flow of inspiration to create\nlike a river. The river always flows until man puts something\nthere to block it, like a dam. Then when the dam is there, we ask\n\nwhy there are so many fish dying, animals disappearing, and\nforests dwindling, when all we need to do was return the river\nback to its natural state and everything will be working\nperfectly fine, the way nature intended it to.\nThis is the same for our minds and our goals. We always\ndream, have big goals, and know what to do at all times when\nwe’re tapped into our inner wisdom and inner intelligence, free\nfrom thinking. If we simply do not think about our thoughts,\nany sort of thoughts about dreams, goals, and desires that\nnaturally arise are all from the divine and that is how you\n“create” goals out of inspiration versus desperation.\nA question that greatly helps me to settle the thinking and\ntap into the limitless well of possibilities of what I could create\nis:\n“If I had infinite money, already traveled the world, had no\nfear, and didn’t receive any recognition for what I do, what\nwould I do or what would I create?”\nWhenever we ask questions, answers always arise. It is\nimpossible for our brains to hear a question and not come up\nwith a response. So when you ask yourself this question,\nwhatever begins to come up for you without any manual\nthinking will be from the divine and from inspiration versus\ndesperation.\nThe way the question is worded is extremely important\nbecause it removes most of the thinking, fear, criticism, and\nexternal reasons of why you would want to do something, so it\nfocuses your answer on what you truly want to create (usually\nit’s for no reason other than you just wanting to create it\nbecause it’s fun), without any influences from the material\nworld.\n\nTry asking the question and seeing what comes up for you!\nYou’ll be surprised at what surfaces, but don’t get caught up\nwith your thinking when those true dreams of yours begin to be\nrevealed to you.\nTo a mind without the limits of thinking, anything is\npossible.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nchapter 10\nUNCONDITIONAL LOVE &\nCREATION\n“The greatest power that mankind could ever\nachieve is the power of unconditional love. This is\nwhen people love with no limitations, conditions\nor boundaries.”\n― Tony Green\nUnconditional Love\nI learned about unconditional love from my extraordinary\ngirlfriend, Makenna. For most of my life, I always questioned\neverything. I had to know the reason behind why things were\nthe way they were, otherwise, I would go crazy. I couldn’t just\nexperience life knowing the meaning and reasoning behind\neverything.\nNaturally, as anyone would in a relationship after dating her\nfor about a year at the time, I asked Makenna why she loved me.\nShe innocently replied that she didn’t know why, she just knew\nshe did. Then she asked me why I loved her and I listed off\ndozens of different reasons why. It ranged from her beautiful\n\nsmile to her adorable laugh, how pure her heart is, how much\nshe loves her family, how intelligent she is, and the list goes on\nalmost indefinitely.\nWe’ve been dating for 6 years now and every few months\nafter that first time I asked, I would ask her why she loved me\nand even up until this point, she still says the same thing, “I\ndon’t know, I just know that I love you — a lot.”\nThis slightly bothered me for so long because I didn’t\nunderstand why she didn’t know why she loved me. I could list\noff 50 reasons of why I loved her, but she couldn’t list a few.\nEven still throughout the years, I loved her so much I didn’t\nreally mind that she didn’t know. I just accepted it and\ncontinued to love her anyway because I couldn’t help myself.\nIt wasn’t until a few months ago that it dawned on me as to\nwhy she couldn’t think of reasons of why she loved me. I began\nto question the reasons that I had for why I loved Makenna.\nThen I had an epiphany that changed my life forever.\nI asked myself, did I love her because of her laugh or because\nshe loves helping other people? What happens if she doesn’t\nlaugh one day or doesn’t help someone that day? Do I stop\nloving her if she doesn’t do the things that I said were the\nreasons that I love her? I realized that if I create reasons for why\nI love her, then it makes my love for her conditional to those\nspecific traits or actions and if she doesn’t do them, then I don’t\nlove her. This is, of course, not true.\nIn that moment, I had the awe-inspiring insight that\nMakenna couldn’t list off reasons of why she loved me because\nher love for me was unconditional. There were no reasons for\nwhy she loved me because if she had reasons, it would mean she\n\nonly loved me if I were exuding those traits or doing those\nthings she had in her mind.\nHer love for me is not based on my mood or what I did, her\nlove for me goes beyond all “reasons” and does not come from a\nplace of reciprocity. She does not love me because I love her, nor\nis she loving me because of what I can do for her. She is\nexperiencing so much love within herself that it’s an outpour of\nan abundance of love that she is gifting me unconditionally.\nAttempting to articulate the feeling of this and where it\ncomes from is probably the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my\nlife because I’m attempting to describe the indescribable.\nFrom this experience, I learned to make my love for Makenna\nunconditional by not placing reasons or conditions for when I\nwould love her (because if I did that, by default I place\nconditions on when I would not love her). There is just so much\nlove in me now because I’ve experienced it that there is simply\nan outpour of unconditional love where I can’t help but love her\nno matter what. This unconditional love doesn’t come from\nexternal reasons, but comes from within from the infinite\nsource we all came from.\nWe are all connected to this pure, unconditional love, which\nis God, the Universe, or whichever name you choose to use. The\nonly thing that gets in the way of this is our own thinking,\nwhich separates and cuts us off from that unconditional love.\nUnconditional Creation\nUnconditional creation is the purest form of creation there\nis. When something is created from unconditional love, we\ncan’t help but to stand there and admire it in awe.\nUnconditional creation is always innovative, unique, new,\ncaptivating, bold, different, revolutionary in its own way. Very\n\nfew people operate in this space because we always put\nconditions around what we do or make.\nFor example, whenever we are working to achieve a goal of\nmaking more money, we might go and try to create income for\nourselves. This is conditional creation because no one wants\nmoney just to have money. Most people want money for\nsomething else or to be able to use it for another thing they\nwant.\nThis, by nature, makes what they are creating, conditional.\nThey are only creating this because they want something else\nout of it. When we create something for something else,\ntypically we do not enjoy the process of creating, because it is\nalways just a means to an end, never an end in itself.\nThis is why we always feel like we’re chasing, grinding,\nhustling, \ntrying, \nand \nfeeling \nconstantly \nstressed \nand\noverwhelmed. Even after we accomplish our goal, we’ll only\nenjoy it for those few seconds and then we’re off to another goal\nwe have to chase because we never actually got what we were\nlooking for.\nWhat we’re ultimately looking for are feelings. We want\nmore money to get a sense of security and peace. We want to\nspend time with our family because it makes us feel so much\nlove and joy. We want to do what we love because it gives us a\nsense of fulfillment inside. These are all ultimately feelings that\nwe are trying to get, but we keep thinking that the goal or object\nwe want will give us those feelings. This idea is inherently\nflawed because our feelings can only ever be generated from\nwithin us, not from external things. External things can\nprompt us to create the feelings, but ultimately it is us that\nproduces those feelings from within ourselves.\n\nWhat’s paradoxical (like everything in the duality of life), is\nthat when we create something without conditions or\nreasons, we actually immediately feel all of the positive\nfeelings we want.\nUnconditional creation is creating something without it\nbeing for another purpose, but purely to create it because we\njust want to create it. It’s not for money, fame, love, or anything\nelse. We create it simply because we want to create it. This is\ncreation from abundance. When we create from this state, we\nalready feel whole inside and all of the love we want to feel is\nwhat we’re feeling in the moment.\nWe can only pursue unconditional creation if we are in the\nstate of non-thinking. Our brains will make us think that it is\npointless to do something just simply because we want to, but\nthat is the secret. As soon as we do things for no other reason,\nwe step into the realm of living our life unconditionally. This is\nwhen we experience flow, oneness, and a direct connection to\nthe Universe/God.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nchapter 11\nWHAT DO YOU DO NEXT AFTER\nEXPERIENCING PEACE, JOY,\nLOVE & FULFILLMENT IN THE\nPRESENT?\n“Don’t think. It complicates things. Just feel, and\nif it feels like home then follow its path.”\n― R.M. Drake.\nIf you’ve been applying the principles in the book, you’ve most\nlikely been able to find peace through non-thinking. If not, I\nhighly encourage you to remember that all of our negative\nfeelings come from our thinking. All you have to do is become\naware of that fact, which will settle the thinking just like the\ndebris settling in dirty water. Once you see that it is just your\nthinking and that there’s nothing to be afraid of, then you will\nexperience true peace in your life in the present.\nOnce you have been able to experience peace, you might be\nunsure as to what to do next. At this point in time, you may be\nexperiencing worry, anxiety, and doubt. Many of my clients,\nincluding myself, began to wonder if they lost their edge and\n\ndrive to do anything in the world. Don’t worry, this is all\nnormal and part of the process of awakening.\nYou’ve already learned the hardest part, which is to practice\nnonthinking and preventing your negative thinking from\ncontrolling your life.\nThe reason why we feel worried, anxiety, and doubt after\nwe’ve experienced peace is because we have just let go of\neverything we thought we knew in the world. What actually\nhappened was the death of the personal ego. A natural\nconsequence is that once the personal ego is threatened, it will\ndo everything in its power to regain control over your life again.\nThe ego is something that we can’t quite get rid of forever,\nwhich is why even after you experience peace, there may be\nfeelings of doubt, worry, and anxiety coming up. It is in this\nmoment that the ego (thinking) will come back up to attempt to\nreclaim your throne. But worry not because you’ve already\nlearned how you can quickly dismantle your ego (your\nthinking) by remembering that your thinking is the only cause\nof your negative feelings. The point is to not try to prevent your\nthinking from ever entering your mind, but to shorten the time\nthat it takes for you to remember that it is just your thinking\nthat’s causing the negative emotions. It’s impossible to prevent\nthinking from happening because it’s so engrained in us.\nFor example, it’s in our human nature that when we\nsuddenly see that we’re about to step on a venomous snake on\nour path, we will freak out. But when you realize that it’s just a\npiece of rope, you see through the illusion, knowing that your\nthinking is what caused you to become afraid and you resume\nyour peaceful walk on the beautiful trail. We can’t prevent that\ninitial reaction, but we can always remember the truth and\n\nreturn to our natural state of peace — and that’s all that\nmatters.\nAnother reason that we may feel anxiety, worry, and doubt\nonce we experience peace is because we were using a colossal\namount of energy when we were thinking all of the time. Most\npeople spend the majority of their day in a state of stress\n(thinking), which consumes enormous amounts of energy.\nWhen we stop thinking, this energy you used to use to think is\nnow “freed up”, but it hasn’t been directed anywhere yet and\nwhat happens is we return to our old patterns of putting that\nenergy back into thinking because that is how we were\nconditioned. What we can do in this case is to channel the\nnewfound energy into our goals of inspiration. This is the cure\nand intervention of preventing this energy from going back into\noverthinking.\nFor this to work, make sure that you’ve spent some time\ncreating your goals out of inspiration (versus desperation) and\nhaving it top of mind so that you can channel all of your energy\ntowards it once you experience this phenomenon. If you have\nonly goals of desperation in your mind, then directing energy\ntowards it will only perpetuate the thinking and negative\nfeelings.\nWhat tends to help many people in this stage is to also have\nan “activation ritual”. An activation ritual is a morning routine\nthat helps them get into a state of non-thinking and flow. It\nhelps you build momentum in a positive direction immediately\nwhen you wake up so that it’s easier to stay in that state of non-\nthinking for the rest of the day. An object in motion will stay in\nmotion. I never understood why spiritual masters and all great\nleaders have a morning routine until I understood the power of\nnon-thinking and momentum.\n\nHere’s the good news: now that all of your energy isn’t tied\nup into thinking anymore, you can now use this freed-up\nenergy and channel it into creating new goals from inspiration\nto fuel and propel you into your new life full of peace, joy, and\nlove.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nchapter 12\nNOTHING IS EITHER GOOD OR\nBAD\n“There is nothing either good or bad but thinking\nmakes it so.”\n― William Shakespeare\nHere’s an analogy that helps put this into perspective. On a\npiano, there are 88 keys. When we look at a piano, we don’t\npoint out specific keys for no reason and say that that key is\n“wrong”. We only think a specific key is “wrong”, if we think\nsomeone is playing a specific song and hits a key that isn’t in the\nsong.\nInherently, the piano has no wrong keys though. There are\nonly keys and notes that sound more or less pleasant when\nplayed consecutively.\nJust like how there are no wrong keys on the piano, there are\nno “wrong” decisions in life. There’s only thinking that give us\npleasant or not so pleasant feelings. When we put things into a\nbucket of right or wrong, good or bad, this creates duality and\nconditions in our lives, which determines how we feel.\n\nFor instance, if we believe that that opposing political parties\nare wrong or bad, this can cause animosity within us and make\nus feel a concoction of negative emotions.\nIf, on the other hand, we see different political parties in the\nsame way as there are different keys on the piano and how there\nare no inherently “wrong” parties, then we open ourselves up to\nexperience love, joy, and peace in the moment. We begin to see\nalternative perspectives that we haven’t seen before and have an\nopportunity to deepen our understanding of the true nature of\nlife.\nIt’s like if we are hiking on a mountain and stop at specific\npoints to look at the beautiful view. There are no “wrong” spots\nthat we can stop at, stand in, and take in the magnificence of\nnature, but by being open to all possible spots we can stand in,\nwe can see the view from different vantage points we haven’t\nseen from before.\nInstead of looking for right or wrong, good or bad in the\nworld, look for truth. Instead of trying to prove we are right and\nthey are wrong, or how they’re better and we’re worse, look for\nthe truth in what’s in front of you. I would only caution this by\nsaying that many people believe what they think is the truth.\nFor the most part, without this deeper understanding of life,\nmost of what we think is not truth, even though it may seem\nlike it.\nTrue truth is not subjective. If it is “true” for one person, but\nnot for another, then it is not universal truth. Look for what is\nuniversally true for every single conscious human being on the\nplanet, no matter who they are, where they’re from, and what\ntheir background is. That is the true truth and that is where\nyou’ll find everything you’ve been searching for. Remember\n\nthat the only place you can find this is deep within your being,\nso don’t try to go looking for it outside of you.\nIf you’re confronted with something that may stir up\nnegative emotions, go within yourself to find the source of\nuniversal truth deep within your soul. If you try to look for the\nanswers outside or try to dig into external reasons for the root\nof why you feel this way, you will be looking for the rest of\neternity and will never find it.\nNegative emotions are an indication of misunderstanding.\nWhen we are gripped by negative emotions, it means that we\nbelieve what we are thinking. It is in this moment that we\nsimply forgot where our experience comes from and that our\nthinking is the cause of our negative emotions.\nAll you have to do is remember that thinking is the root\ncause of how we’re feeling. Once this is brought into your\nawareness, don’t fight the thinking. Just become aware that it is\nyour thinking that’s causing the ill feelings, welcome it with\nlove, and it will slowly dissipate before your eyes. Not too long\nafter, you’ll return to your natural state of peace, love, and joy.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nchapter 13\nHOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO\nWITHOUT THINKING?\n“The intuitive mind is a sacred gift, and the\nrational mind is a faithful servant. We have\ncreated a society that honors the servant and has\nforgotten the gift.”\n― Albert Einstein\nIn the previous chapter, we discussed how there is no right or\nwrong in this world. This chapter will build on the last to\ndeepen our understanding and illuminate how to know what to\ndo without thinking.\nAlthough there are no right or wrong decisions we can make,\njust like how there are no wrong keys on a piano, there are\ndecisions or “keys” that are more pleasant than others\ndepending on the context. Knowing that there is no right or\nwrong relieves us from quite a bit a pressure to “choose the\nright one”.\nWhen we make decisions, we want to rely on non-thinking.\nWhen we try to think, analyze, create pros and cons lists, and\n\nask everyone (including our pets) for advice, it causes anxiety\nand frustration until we make the decision. Most of the time, we\nalready know deep down what to do in any specific situation.\nThis is often referred to as your gut feeling, intuition, or inner\nwisdom. What we do is try to confirm our intuition with the\nexternal world and this is where most of the negative emotions\nbegin to surface, wreaking havoc on our mental state because of\neveryone’s opinions.\nOnly you can know what you want to do. No one else can tell\nyou this. There will be mentors and coaches that can guide you\nto help you along the way, but the best ones will tell you to\nlisten to your intuition and look within yourself for the answer\n(the truth is only ever within you). This is why many of us\nexperience the phenomenon of regret when we knew deep\ndown what we should have done based on our gut feeling, but\nwe ignored it and listened to someone else’s advice or opinion.\nYour intuition will always lead you to where you need to go\nand what you should do at any moment in time. It’s like a real-\ntime inner GPS that will tell you when to take a detour and\nwhich path you should take if there is a blockage in the road to\nyour destination. It’s guaranteed that our inner GPS will guide\nus to exactly where we want to go, but what’s not guaranteed is\nhow or which path it will put us on to take us there. There are\ninfinite circumstances that can happen on the journey to the\ndestination, but you can rest assured your GPS will get you\nthere.\nImportant Note:\nSociety will almost never confirm our intuition until it’s\nmainstream already. For this reason, if you try to look outside\nfor confirmation on what you know to be true for you, you’ll\nalmost always get backlash and differing opinions on what next\n\nsteps you should take. Avoid looking externally for answers.\nFollow your intuition, your gut feeling, your inner wisdom, and\nthe Universe/God. When you do this, you will begin to see\nmiracles occurring in your life that you never could have\nexpected or even dreamed of. Those who have the faith and\ncourage to do this, will discover the true joy, peace, and love\nthey have been looking for while enjoying the miracle of life.\nSo how do we know what to do without thinking?\nThe truth is most of us know what to do, but we are just\nafraid to do it. For instance, if we want to lose weight, most of\nus know exactly what we need to do. The formula to losing\nweight isn’t rocket science or written in hieroglyphics. Most of\nus know that all we need to do is burn more calories than we\nconsume, workout and eat healthy foods and we’ll lose weight.\nFor anything in life, you most likely already know deep down\nwhat to do, but are afraid of doing it or don’t believe that you\nare good enough to do it.\nThe first step is realizing that you already know what to do,\nyou just think you don’t because of fear or self-doubt. If you\ndon’t have any fear or self-doubt about the situation and still\nsee that you don’t know what to do, then the next step is to\ntrust your inner wisdom (Infinite Intelligence) that it will give\nyou the answers you need. We have the ability to access an\ninfinite number of thoughts, so there’s definitely no shortage of\nideas on what you can do in any given moment. The only thing\nthat is stopping us from accessing this abundance of knowledge\nis our own thinking.\nHenry Ford once said, “Whether you think that you can or\ncan’t, you’re right.” If we walk around our lives thinking we\ncan’t, then we immediately block ourselves from the limitless\npossibilities of what we can do in any given moment in time.\n\nBut when we release the brake in our mind and realize that it’s\njust our thinking holding us back, we automatically return to\nour natural state of abundance and unlimited possibilities and\nin that moment, we can receive any answer we need on what to\ndo.\nIn short, know that you already know and if you don’t know,\nknow that you can know what you need to know.\nIf you know that you can always know, then what you need\nto know will always come to you. Trust in your own intuition\nand inner wisdom. It has always and will always be there for\nyou when you need it as long as you trust that it will.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nchapter 14\nHOW TO FOLLOW YOUR\nINTUITION\n“Have the courage to follow your heart and\nintuition. They somehow already know what you\ntruly want to become. Everything else is\nsecondary.”\n― Steve Jobs\nIn a previous chapter, we talked about how we don’t need to\nthink in order to thrive in the world and that the way we do\nthrive is to remove the thinking we have going on. The state of\nflow is a state of pure oneness and a direct connection to\neverything around us. Because there is no separation when we\nare in that state, we can also say that it is a state where we are in\ndirect connection and alignment with God/Universe/Infinite\nIntelligence.\nWhat thinking does is sever this connection we have with\nthe divine, causing us to feel stress, frustration, anger,\nresentment, depression, and all of these negative emotions\n\nmany of us feel on a daily basis. This is why some religions\ndescribe Hell as the complete separation from God.\nFrom now on for simplicity’s sake, I’ll be using the term\nnonthinking instead of flow, but they really are synonymous\nwhen I use them in this book. This state of non-thinking also\nmeans a direct connection to Infinite Intelligence.\nMany will attribute the state of non-thinking or flow with a\nparticular activity that we love to do and that’s the only time we\ncan be in flow. This is far from the truth. We can be in a state of\nnonthinking at any point in time. The only time we can really\nbe in a state of non-thinking is in the present moment. We can\nonly see reality in the present moment and when we are\nactively thinking, it means we are either in the past or future\n(which don’t exist). Only in the present moment can the truth\nbe found. This is why all of the spiritual masters and leaders\nalways teach to meditate, pray, and to be in the present\nmoment. In the Bible, when Moses asks God her name, She\nreplies with “I am.” God didn’t say that She was or will be\n(because they don’t exist), but simply with “I am.” God, truth,\nthe Universe, freedom, peace, joy, and love (these terms are all\nsynonymous) can only be found, and therefore experienced, in\nthe present.\nWhen you’re following your intuition, it means you are\ntrusting yourself and having faith that you always have the\ninner wisdom necessary to help guide you through everything\nin life. This is a state of non-thinking or flow.\nLet’s explore how we can make this concept practical and\nbring it into our everyday lives. What does following your\nintuition and inner wisdom look like and how can we do it?\n\nWhen you’re following your intuition, you’re completely\ntapped into something greater than your personal self. You’re in\na state of nonthinking (flow) and direct connection with God. In\nthis state, you always know what you need to do without\nthinking and are guided by Infinite Intelligence. It almost\nseems like we’re not doing anything when we’re in this zone\nbecause we lose our sense of personal self and become one with\nlife. When we’re in this state, miracles occur such as business\ndeals coming out of nowhere, people showing up at the right\nplace at the right time, money comes in exactly when we need\nit, connections that we were looking for spontaneously fall\nupon our laps, and life seems almost magical. Time seems to\nwarp and bend around us and it’s because there is no sense of it.\nWe proceed to then accomplish more within a few days than\nothers do within a month. Abundance, love, joy, peace,\nharmony, and gratitude are inevitable and inseparable feelings\nthat are experienced in this state.\nEvery single person has experienced instances where they\nhave felt like this before. Although many have experienced this\nphenomenon, very few are able to maintain it for extended\nperiods of time. The main reason is because most relapse back\ninto thinking and believe that they have to “figure it out”\nthemselves. It is when we begin thinking that we lose this\npower of creating miracle-like events and circumstances.\nThe truth is that we don’t have to have it all figured out, nor\ndo we even have to figure it all out. How can our limited minds\npossibly understand and try to manipulate the entire world to\nour desires?\nIt is only when we think we know more than God that we run\ninto problems.\n\nThe great news is that we don’t have to know more than Her\nnor do we have to even think. All we have to do is trust in our\nown intuition and have faith that our inner wisdom will show\nus the way that is best for us. When you ask people who are the\nmost abundant, joyful, and successful how they made it, they\nwill usually attribute their success to some sort of higher power\nor luck. These people have trusted in something greater than\nthemselves and thus attribute it to that instead of attributing\ntheir success to sheer willpower and brute force.\nThere’s so much in life that is completely out of our control\nand we can really only control a very small portion of it. This is\nnot to say that we give up because we can’t control our lives, it’s\nquite the opposite. When we realize that we don’t have to\ncontrol and try to force everything to happen our way, we\nbecome free from suffering, pain, and frustration and begin to\nfall into this state of non-thinking where things just all happen\nfor us instead of to us. We begin to see that everything was\nperfectly placed in our lives to help us become the exact person\nwe are now and that if anything were changed, we would not\nhave what we do now. There are millions of small\ncircumstances and events that have to have been meticulously\norchestrated for us to be where we are now. To plan that would\nbe impossible and futile, yet here we are. This is the miracle of\nlife.\nTo go back on a point we just made about us not having to\ncontrol things in our lives, there’s a caveat I want to highlight. It\nis true that we cannot control everything that happens in our\nlives, but what we can control is whether we think or not\n(which is the root cause of all of our problems and negative\nemotions). We can decide to change our experience of life\nwhenever we want and how we feel at any moment. This is how\nwe can choose to be happy — by choosing to let go of our\n\nthinking. Isn’t that what ultimately matters at the end of the\nday? It’s not about what we have, but how we feel inside that is\nthe true measure of success, joy, and fulfillment.\nThe other point I wanted to bring up is that although we\ncan’t control a lot of things, what we can have a say in is what\nwe want in our lives, but not necessarily the how. For instance,\nwe have the gift of imagination (access to Infinite Intelligence),\nwhich means we can come up with anything that we want in\nour lives. This is an amazing blessing, but where things can go\nsour is when we think that we need to figure out the how in\norder to make it happen. It is at this point that most people give\nup or continue down the path of brute force to try to bring it to\nlife and suffer daily for it. This is why people believe that we\nhave to work hard and suffer for what we want in life. That is\nsimply not true. It is only true if we think we have to figure out\nthe “how” to get what we want in life. Our job is to come up\nwith what we want, not how to get it. The how is really up to\nthe Universe. This is the best-case scenario anyway because\nthere are an infinite number of ways to bring about what you\nwant in life, so for our little finite brains to figure it out would\nbe futile, nonetheless.\nWe only suffer when we try to figure it all out, but we don’t\nhave to. This is when we want to rely on our intuition and inner\nwisdom to help show us exactly what we need to do in real time\nto manifest what we want. There’s no need to try to figure it all\nout in advance. Our part is to hold in our minds what we want\nand get into a state of non-thinking. This enables us to access\nour Infinite Intelligence (God) so that the answers are\nrevealed to us exactly when we need it.\nThe path forward is only revealed when we begin walking.\nThere’s never going to be a time where the entire path is\n\nilluminated for us to see beforehand. That would completely\nnegate the need for faith and that is why faith and trust is of\nutmost importance when manifesting something.\nWe must have complete, unwavering faith that what we\nwant to create will come to us and we can only do this by fully\ntrusting in the Universe to orchestrate how it will happen. We\ncan always get what we desire in life, it just may not be on our\ntimeline or in the way we want it to manifest.\nOur intuition and inner wisdom (God) actually speaks to us\nall of the time. You know that small voice inside that always\nknows what you should do? Maybe it’s to leave your job, forgive a\nperson that hurt you, ask someone out, or reconnect with\nsomeone. It’s that gut feeling you get where you know what you\nneed to do. Have you ever regretted not doing something in a\nmoment your gut told you to do it? Have you ever had a gut\nfeeling to do something, but you have no logical reasoning as to\nwhy, but you did it anyway and amazing things happened\nafterward? That is your intuition.\nOur intuition does come to us in the form of thoughts, but\nremember that there’s a stark difference between thoughts and\nthinking, as we discussed in a previous chapter. Thoughts are\ndivine by nature and feel like they pop into our minds out of\nnowhere. Thinking on the other hand is a manual, strenuous\neffort that we create ourselves, which feels very heavy and\ntypically has negative emotions attached to it. When you have\ndivine thoughts from Infinite Intelligence, there’s a sense of\nknowingness to it. It contains the truth and you just know deep\ndown that it’s right. Your intuition will almost never seem\nlogical or rational, but that’s exactly what we want because we\ndon’t want it to be predictable. If it were predictable, it wouldn’t\n\nbe miraculous and it wouldn’t contain the infinite possibilities\nof the Universe which are all spontaneous by nature.\nYour intuition will almost always go against your logical,\nrational mind, so be prepared for that. It will whisper to you\nthat you should talk to this random person in a coffee shop that\nleads to a beautiful friendship or for you to call up a friend\nspontaneously where you find out they really needed someone\nto be there for them during a difficult time. It will tell you to\nstep into and live in your divine gift and put yourself out there\nto share the truth of what you know. It will softly beckon you to\npursue what you truly want in life versus following what\neveryone else says that you should want. These are a few\nexamples of the infinite numbers of ways it will speak to you\nand when you follow it, it will always create miracles and\nabundance beyond your wildest imaginations.\nSo why don’t more people listen to their intuition if it always\nknows what to do and creates abundance whenever it is\nfollowed? Fear.\nListening to our intuition can be scary or extremely\ndaunting. This is because our intuition lives in the space of the\nunknown. In order words, our intuition is spiritual and\noperates in the field of infinite possibilities, which by nature is\nthe field of unknown. We as humans always fear the unknown\nbecause we can’t predict what might happen. It is only when we\nstep into the unknown that we can begin to experience the\nlimitless possibilities that life can bring to us. This is why\nmagical things and miracles happen when we trust our\nintuition. We are literally stepping into the zone of pure\npossibility. It is for this reason that we only need to know the\n“what” of what we want to manifest, but not the “how”.\n\nThe only way you can enter this space of miracles is through\nnonthinking. If we think, we immediately get ejected out of the\nspace and enter a state of anxiety, worry and suffering. Our\nthinking will try to predict what might happen based on the\npast. This is why most people get more of the same of what they\nhave always gotten. They try to use their limited personal mind\nto create something they have never experienced before,\ninnocently not realizing that they must step into the unknown\nby entering the state of non-thinking and listening to their\nintuition. We can only ever create something we have never\nexperienced in the realm of infinite possibilities, but the only\nway to make that happen is to go where we haven’t gone before,\nwhich is the unknown.\nIn summary, your intuition always knows what you need to\ndo in the present moment, but the only way to access it is by\ngetting into a state of non-thinking. Your personal mind will\nfreak out because you’re stepping into the space of infinite\npossibilities (the unknown), but if you remember that it is just\nthinking that is making you feel fear, the fearful thinking will\nfall away and the courage you need to act on your intuition will\nnaturally surface. It is in this moment that you must have faith\nin your inner wisdom (God) to guide you through life even\nwhen you don’t know what will happen next — but that’s the\nadventure and joy in it. The unknown is also the only way to\nmanifest what you want in life if you don’t already have it. You\nhave to do what you haven’t done in order to get what you don’t\nhave. When you’re operating from intuition, it’s not like you’re\ngoing to feel fear all of the time. The fear is only present as long\nas your thinking is revolving around fear. Once you\nacknowledge the fear and understand that it’s only your\nthinking that’s causing those feelings, the illusion will fall\napart, and you’ll fall back into peace, joy, and pure love. This is\n\nthe space you want to stay in, which will allow you to create the\npositive feelings that are the prerequisite to manifesting all you\ncould possibly imagine for yourself.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nchapter 15\nCREATING SPACE FOR MIRACLES\n“Today I make space for miracles. I recognize that\nit’s not how big a miracle is that’s important but\nhow much room I create for it.”\n― Kyle Gray\nThe Story of the Zen Master and a Scholar - Empty Your Cup\nOnce upon a time, there was a wise Zen master. People traveled\nfrom far away to seek his help. In return, he would teach them\nand show them the way to enlightenment. On this particular\nday, a scholar came to visit the master for advice. “I have come to\nask you to teach me about Zen,” the scholar said.\nSoon, it became obvious that the scholar was full of his own\nopinions and knowledge. He interrupted the master repeatedly\nwith his own stories and failed to listen to what the master had\nto say. The master calmly suggested that they should have tea.\nSo the master gently poured his guest a cup. The cup was\nfilled, yet he kept pouring until the cup overflowed onto the\ntable, onto the floor, and finally onto the scholar’s robes. The\n\nscholar cried, “Stop! The cup is full already. Can’t you see?”\n“Exactly,” the Zen master replied with a smile. “You are like this\ncup — so full of ideas that nothing more will fit in. Come back to\nme with an empty cup.”\nIt is ironic how much could be written about nothing. That’s\nwhat space is: nothing. When we study the Universe and\nquantum physics, we realize that everything comes from\nnothing. Therefore, the great spiritual masters call this The\nGreat Nothingness. For there to be creation, there must first be\nspace. The same is true for our own minds. If you want\nsomething new to be created, such as new thoughts, then you\nmust first create space so that you can receive new ideas that\ncan change your life. Just like the teacup, if your mind is\ncompletely full of old thinking, it is impossible to have any new\nthoughts come into your mind to create the change you seek.\nThe way we can create this space is through non-thinking.\nAs soon as we stop our strenuous efforts to think, we\nimmediately create space where new thoughts and ideas can\nenter our minds. Questions that challenge our current way of\nthinking are also a great way to create space in our minds.\nAll the magic happens in this space of nothingness. For\ninstance, great athletes go through intense periods of training,\nbut the best athletes know that they need an equally intense\nperiod of rest afterwards to stay in peak performance. It is\nduring this rest period that they recover, build muscle, and\nbecome stronger. This space they create for themselves through\nrest is where everything they wanted from the workout\nmanifests.\nWhen Thomas Edison was confronted with a particularly\nchallenging problem, he would sleep in his chair while holding\na steel ball in each of his hands. Eventually he would slip into a\n\ndeep enough stage of sleep where the ball would drop, wake\nhim up and a solution to his problem would pop into his mind.\nEverything comes from nothing, and Edison understood this\nconcept of creating space for new thoughts to enter his mind\ninstead of attempting to effort his way into solving problems\nwith his old way of thinking. He knew that old thinking was not\ngoing to give him the solution to his challenges.\n“We can’t solve problems by using the same level\nof consciousness we were at when we created\nthem.”\n― Albert Einstein\nEinstein had different quirky, enigmatic behaviors just like\nEdison, but a similar understanding of creating space. When\nEinstein was stuck on a difficult problem, he would stop\nworking on it and play the violin. As he was playing, the answer\nwould come to him out of seemingly nowhere and then he’d\nhave the solution to his problem. Einstein had created space\nwithin his mind through non-thinking to be able to receive\ndivine downloads from the Universe.\nWe don’t have to try to figure everything out. Even the\npeople we deem as geniuses didn’t strain and effort their way\ninto making the greatest discoveries in the world, so what\nmakes us think that we have to? We are no different than them\nand are all connected to the same Source. With the correct\nunderstanding, we can also receive insights to any challenge\nwe’re facing. We’re only ever one thought, one insight, and one\nidea away from living a completely different experience of life.\nHere’s the process for receiving divine downloads when\nyou’re confronted with a challenge:\n\n1. Become aware that your thinking is the root cause of all\nnegative emotions.\n2. Create space by surrendering any manual thinking from\nthe personal mind and have complete faith that your inner\nwisdom (God/Universe/Infinite Intelligence) will give you\nthe answer. Also surrender the how and when the answer\nwill come to you.\n3. Become aware of any feelings that arise as you surrender\nand magnify those feelings of love, peace, and joy. Meet\nwhat you’re facing with love and the answer will come to\nyou.\nIf it seems almost too simple, that’s a good thing. The truth is\nalways simple. Although it may be simple, it’s not always easy\nand even the greatest spiritual masters struggle at times.\nWhat’s important is not when we get caught in our thinking\n(because it’s inevitable), but what we do when we catch\nourselves thinking again. As long as you continually remember\nthat we can only ever feel what we’re thinking and that\nthinking is the root cause of all of our suffering, then you’re\nfree.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nchapter 16\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU BEGIN\nLIVING IN NON-THINKING\n(POTENTIAL OBSTACLES)\n“Do not let the behavior of others destroy your\ninner peace.”\n― Dalai Lama\nAs you go along your journey of non-thinking, you’ll inevitably\nhit some roadblocks along the way, so I’d like to bring up some\nof those potential issues before you encounter them so that it is\na little bit easier for you.\nOnce you begin living your life in non-thinking, you’ll be\nhaving the time of your life not having very many worries,\nstress, or problems in your life. Many of them will just vanish\nbefore your eyes because if you don’t see things as problems\nanymore, they literally stop being a problem for you. What\nyou’ll notice is that you haven’t felt this type of peace and\nserenity in your life before and thus it will feel unfamiliar.\nWe as humans biologically don’t like what’s unfamiliar\nbecause it means uncertainty. What’s ironic is that right about\n\nthis time is when most people begin thinking that something is\nwrong because they feel so happy and peaceful the majority of\nthe day. Many feel like they’re not as productive, have lost their\n“edge”, or are just lazier. This is far from the truth and it’s just\nyour brain attempting to begin thinking again to create the\nillusion of “safety” it wants to feel. The truth is that we are most\nproductive as humans when we are happy and in a state of non-\nthinking. Time seems to fly when we are in a state of pure joy.\nTasks are easier, we perform better, people gravitate to us, we\nattract way more abundance, and miracles begin to occur out of\nnowhere. You just have to stay in the state of nonthinking long\nenough to experience these things and you’ll never want to go\nback.\nThis is when faith becomes of the utmost importance —\nhaving faith that things will be okay. Know that the Universe is\nworking for you, not against you. That everything happens for\na reason and that there are no failures in life, just lessons and\nopportunities for us to grow. We must have faith in the\nunknown because that’s the only place that contains the\npossibility for anything to be different than the life we’re living\nright now. The unknown is where all possibilities exist,\nincluding everything you could possibly ever want for your life.\nOnce you have the courage to make the leap into the unknown\nand to not be afraid of it anymore, it’s impossible that your life\nwon’t change.\nIf you begin to feel like something’s wrong because you feel\nway too peaceful and content, know that it’s only your mind\ntrying to make you think again. Your mind is the greatest\nsalesman and knows exactly what to say to get you to bring you\nback into its vicious cycle of destructive thinking. It is in this\nmoment that you have the choice to have faith in the unknown\nand stay in the feeling of happiness, peace, and love or to go\n\nback to the old patterns of familiar pain and psychological\nsuffering. We can either choose to be free and happy in the\nunknown or to be confined and suffer in the familiar.\nIf you do fall back into thinking, it is completely okay. Do not\nbeat yourself up about it. Don’t feel guilty that it happened.\nThere’s no need to punish yourself because that will only\nperpetuate the thinking. Know that it is absolutely human to\nthink. Once you catch yourself and see that it is your thinking\nthat’s causing your suffering, that’s all you have to do in order to\nbring yourself to a state of peace, happiness, and love again. The\ntransition can happen painlessly and effortlessly if you let it.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nchapter 17\nNOW WHAT?\n“There will come a time when you believe\neverything is finished, that will be the beginning.”\n― Louis L’Amor\nAlthough this is the end of the book, it is just the beginning of a\nnew life for you. You are only ever one thought away from\npeace, love, and joy — which come from a state of non-thinking.\nRemember this and keep it close to your heart because it is all\nthe hope you need when life gets inevitably tough. In the\nbeginning, I promised you that you will not be the same person\nas you were before you read this book. If you began reading this\nbook with the intention of having an open and willing mind,\nthen you have already received numerous insights that have\ncompletely changed the way you look at life and thus you are\nnot the same person as you were before. Once you see\nsomething new from an insight, you cannot unsee it. Once your\nconsciousness expands, it cannot contract again. We may forget\nfrom time to time and cause ourselves to suffer when we begin\nthinking again, but as soon as we remember that, we\n\nimmediately realize that we are the ever-expanding awareness\nof life itself and find love, peace, and joy in the present.\nIf this seems like it is too simple and that it can’t be all there\nis, that is just your mind causing you to think again. The truth\nis simple and will always be. Anything that makes something\ncomplex and intricate is only taking you further away from the\ntruth. The truth is not something you think, but something\nthat you know and feel deep in your soul. Listen to that still\ninner wisdom inside of you that knows all of this. Let it guide\nyou through your life. We are most fulfilled when we listen to\nour soul. The world will continuously advertise to us that we\nare not enough, that we are missing something or don’t have\neverything we want. People will constantly bombard you with\ntheir own opinions, judgements, and advice. Know that they are\ninnocently caught up in their thinking and thank them for\ncaring, but do not fall into the illusion that you need any of that.\nEverything you could possibly ever want and need is already\ninside of you. You are already all of the love, joy, peace, and\nfulfillment you have ever wanted. It is only when we forget that\nfact and get caught up in our thinking that we do not see it.\nContinue to live in this state of pure peace and let go of any\nthinking that may pop up in your mind. The longer you stay in\nthis space, the more miracles will show up in your life.\nAlthough you can go and share this message with every person\nyou meet, you won’t even need to because they will notice\nsomething completely different about you. You’ll be glowing,\nvibrant, and emanating pure love and joy — and they will begin\nasking why and how. You are now equipped with everything\nyou need to know on how to stop your own psychological\nsuffering and embody a state of peace, love, and joy, which is\nalways available to you at all times. There’s a good chance that\n\nyou have already experienced the bliss of knowing and being\nthis.\nThere is absolutely no coincidence that you have picked up\nthis book and for us to be able to share our journey here\ntogether. I am always amazed at all of the divine intercessions\nthat have to had happened for us to be here together right now.\nIt is truly humbling and an incredible blessing that you have\nallowed me to guide you through this infinitely beautiful\nexperience we call life.\nBefore we close this chapter, I do have one small favor to ask.\nIf you have found this book helpful or insightful, it would be an\nincredible honor if you could take 60 seconds to leave a review\nabout this book on Amazon. I would truly love to hear about\nyour thoughts, insights, feedback, your personal journey and\neverything in between. The few words you share there will help\nspread this message to so many souls who are also looking for\nthe same answers you are and it will change someone’s life\n(because who doesn’t read Amazon reviews before they buy\nsomething, right?).\nFor anyone that is interested in connecting with me even\nfurther, \nI \nwould \nlove \nto \nhear \nfrom \nyou \nat\nhello@josephnguyen.org about anything and everything. It\nbrings me such a deep feeling of joy to hear other people’s\nstories, so I do keep my inbox open for those who would like to\nshare. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\nWith Love & Light,\nJoseph\n\nP.S. In the next few pages, there will be a summary and guides to help\nyou implement much of what is mentioned in this book. If you feel\ninspired to get additional help with applying these principles to change\nyour life or business, I’d love to invite you to visit my website\n(www.josephnguyen.org) to explore possibilities of how we can work\ntogether.\nOceanofPDF.com\n\nSUMMARY OF NON-THINKING\nThinking is the root cause of all suffering.\nThere is no other answer to why we feel negative emotions\nother than that it is from our own thinking. Everything can\nbe traced back to our thinking, which makes problem\nsolving very simple. Once we realize that our thinking is\ncausing how we feel, we can let go of it and we return to our\nnatural state of peace, love, and joy. When we let go of our\nthinking, it creates space for us to be able to allow all\npositive emotions we want to feel to surface from within\nus. We don’t live in reality, we live in a PERCEPTION of\nreality, which is created by our own thinking.\nThinking is NOT an effect of our experiences, but the\nCAUSE of it.\nThe thoughts in our minds are not facts.\nOur thinking only has control over us if we believe it. Let go\nof the belief in the thought to let go of the suffering.\nOur feelings are direct feedback and an innate internal\nguidance system to let us know whether we are lacking\nunderstanding or have absolute clarity of truth. Feelings\nare an invitation to deepen our understanding of the truth.\nWe are in flow when we are not thinking.\nThere is no separation between us and the Universe and all\nof life when we are not thinking. It is only when we think\nthat we cut ourselves from Source and feel separate from all\nthings (the birth of the ego).\n\nThinking and thoughts are two different things. Thinking\nis a verb and requires our manual effort, which causes\nsuffering. Thoughts are nouns, which do not come from us\nand are divine downloads from the Universe.\nWe think because it is a biological response to survive. Our\nminds think only because it is trying to keep us alive, but it\ndoes not help us thrive. It is only concerned with our safety\nand survival, but not our fulfillment. Thinking holds us\nback from our Highest Selves by causing negative feelings\nwithin us that prevent us from following our true callings.\nOur minds are limited to our personal experiences. If you\nwant to receive insights, creativity, and knowledge beyond\nthe capabilities of your current self, simply choose to listen\nto Infinite Intelligence rather than your finite mind. This\ninfinite source of truth is available to all people at all times\nif we allow it to be.\nUniversal Intelligence/Mind is the energy that is everything\nin this universe. It is the source of where everything comes\nfrom that is before form and we are made up of it. This\nenergy has a feeling, which is the feeling is love, peace, joy,\nconnection, and well-being. This is what we fall back into\nwhen we let go of our thinking and it is our natural state.\nSince we are all always connected to the same source of\nInfinite Intelligence, once we let go of our thinking, we\naccess new thoughts, ideas, and insights, even if we have\nnever experienced them before. The more we trust our\nintuition and this Infinite Intelligence, the more we will\nreceive these insights that are always available to us.\nPeace, love, joy, and all positive emotions are our default\nstates as humans. It is only when we begin thinking, then\nwe get taken out of that natural state. Once we let go of our\n\nthinking, we fall back into our natural state of being and\nexperience all positive feelings effortlessly.\nWe are ever only one thought or one insight away from\nexpanding our consciousness and experiencing a deeper\nfeeling of love at all times, which comes from a state of non-\nthinking.\nClarity is the nature of our minds and our default state. It is\nonly when we get caught up in our thinking that things do\nnot seem so. If we let go of our thinking, we return to our\n“factory default” setting of peace, love, joy, and a quiet\nmind.\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with anyone or\nanything in the Universe, but our thinking will make us\nthink so. You do not have to be fixed because you are not\nbroken. There is only something for you to realize and\nremember, which is that thinking is the root cause of our\nsuffering. You do not have to do anything about your\nthinking. All you have to do is shift your understanding of\nthinking and you will fall back into the truth of who you\nare, which is beyond your thinking, your body, and\neverything you think you know. As soon as you let go of\nyour thinking, you become one with Infinite Intelligence,\nallowing you to feel a never-ending abundance of love,\npeace, and joy that is always available to you because that is\nyour true nature.\nWhen you make space for Infinite Intelligence, it makes\nspace for you. The more you trust it, the more it trusts you.\nThere’s never an end to how much space you can make for\nit. When you prioritize making space in your life and in\nyour mind for Infinite Intelligence to come through, your\nlife will change.\n\nA Guide to Stop Thinking\nEliminate things that may make your more prone to\nthinking (or things that cause you to be in a fight or flight\nmode).\nEliminate as many things and actions in your life that do\nnot inspire you or excite you.\nCreate an environment that helps put you into a\nnonthinking state.\nCreate a morning activation ritual to help you start your\nday in a peaceful, non-thinking state. Use this space to\nreceive insights from Infinite Intelligence to help you\nnavigate through life.\nCreate space in your day to be able to decompress, relax, and\nreturn to a state of non-thinking. Write out things you can\ndo during your day that can help you achieve this. It could\nbe journaling, taking a walk, meditating, playing with your\npets, taking a nap, doing yoga, or anything relaxing.\nFramework For How To Stop Thinking\n1. Realize thinking is the root of all suffering (understand\nthe true nature of thinking).\nRealize if you’re suffering, you’re thinking.\nRealize the difference between thinking and thoughts.\nDon’t try to find the root cause, thinking is the root cause.\n2. Create a space for persisting negative thinking\nAllow them to be there and acknowledge them for what they are.\n\nUnderstand that you are the sacred space that holds these feelings, but\nthat you are not the feelings themselves.\nDon’t be afraid to be alone with your thinking and have the courage to\nallow it to be in your consciousness.\nWelcome it in and see that the thinking just wants to be acknowledged.\nRealize that negative thoughts only have power over you if you believe in\nthem.\nOnce you allow them to exist in your consciousness and don’t resist the\nfeelings, you can then look beyond the feelings to see the truth behind it\nall.\nEvery feeling contains a seed of truth in it which will help you deepen\nyour awareness and allow you to experience life more fully.\n3. Once you acknowledge the thinking, allow it all to pass\nand allow yourself to just be without attaching to anything.\nNaturally positive emotions will arise, like peace, love, and\njoy. Allow yourself to enjoy these emotions as they come\nup. If the negative feeling still persists, then go back to step\none and repeat until you’ve been able to find some peace.\nPotential Obstacles\n1. Not wanting to let go of thinking because you think that\nit is what got you to where you are.\nWhile this is true, you must realize that what got you here, won’t get you\nthere. If you want to break the vicious cycle of suffering and the same self-\ndestructive patterns repeating in your life, you’ll have to do something\ndifferent. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but\nexpecting a different result. The real question is, do you want to be happy\nor not? If you understand that thinking is the root cause of all of your\nsuffering and do not want to be unhappy any longer, then you will be able\nto make the leap of faith into non-thinking.\n2. Not enough faith\nIn order for there to even be a possibility that there could be a life filled\nwith joy, peace, and love every single day, you must first believe that it is\npossible. One must also believe that they are part of something much\n\nbigger that is the life force that has been taking care of them this whole\ntime (the Universe/God). Having faith in something much bigger than we\nare without being able to fully comprehend it with our finite minds is the\nonly way we can surrender our manual efforts and experience total peace\nin our lives versus worrying about everything.\n3. Fear\nFear is a completely normal emotion when it comes to trusting in the\nUniverse, which is also the unknown. Fear is an indication that something\nis very important to us, so this is a great sign. Everything we could ever\nwant is on the other side of fear and deep down you know this is the\ntruth. The test we must pass in order to obtain all we desire is fear itself.\nThe way out is through and going deep within yourself to see and know\nthat you will be okay no matter what. That this fear cannot and will not\nkill you, but if you do not confront it, it will take the life of all your dreams\ninstead. Thinking is the root cause of fear. If you don’t think, there is no\nfear. Follow the framework for how to stop thinking to overcome the fear\nand experience what life can be like without limits.\nHow You Will Know If You’re In A State Of Non-Thinking\nIf you’re not thinking, you will experience complete peace, love,\njoy, passion, excitement, inspiration, bliss, and any positive\nemotion your mind can conceive. You’ll feel like you’re in flow.\nYou’ll lose sense of time, space, and even yourself. You’ll feel\n“one” with life. This is how you know you are not thinking.\nReflection Prompts\nOn a scale of 1-10, how much did you think today? (1 being low,\n10 being high)\nWhat percentage of your day was spent in fight or flight mode?\nWhat percentage was spent in a relaxed, calm state?\n\nA Guide To Creating A Non-Thinking Environment\nYour environment will either induce and support the state of\nnonthinking or it can make you more prone to thinking.\nAlthough we create our reality from the inside-out, many times\nwe are still affected by our environment. Since we are spiritual\nbeings living in a physical world, we cannot completely detach\nfrom this 3D world just yet, so it is important to create an\nenvironment that is conducive to non-thinking. In order to be\nproductive, the best way to do it is to eliminate distractions\ninstead of trying to do more.\nSimilarly, if we eliminate many of the things that we know that\ncan trigger us to relapse back into thinking, then we will be able\nto stay in a peaceful state of non-thinking much easier.\nRemember that changing your environment and not yourself\nwill not work long term. A delicate blend of both will be what\nyou need to create a beautiful life you love to live.\nFramework For Removing Thinking Triggers\n1. Perform an audit to see what things can make you more\nsusceptible to thinking and make a list.\nA. Write down everything that comes to mind. What can help is to tap\ninto your intuition and feel energetically in your body if this specific thing\nin your environment will help or hurt you. If you are in a calm, relaxed\nstate, the answer will be obvious.\nB. If you’re having trouble with coming up with things, try to remember\nwhat things tend to put you into a fight or flight mode, make you anxious\nor overthink. Anything that puts you into a survival state will not help\nyou maintain a state of non-thinking.\n\nC. If it is still difficult to think of things, you can keep a journal as you go\nabout your week and write down anything that seems to put you into a\nfight or flight mode. You’ll have a nice list by the end of the week.\n2. Organize all of the things you wrote down into categories\nA. Here are some examples of categories\nI. Physical Health\na. What things that when you put into your body can make\nyou more prone to experience a fight or flight response\n(anxiety, stress, overthinking)? Foods, stimulants, drinks, etc.\nII. Physical Environment\nb. What things in your physical environment can make you\nmore prone to experience a fight or flight response (anxiety,\nstress, overthinking)?\nIII. Digital Environment\nc. What things on your phone, computer, or TV can make you\nmore prone to experience a fight or flight response (anxiety,\nstress, overthinking)?\nIV. Digital Consumption\nd. What media/content when you consume can make you more prone to\nexperience a fight or flight response (anxiety, stress, overthinking)?\n3. After you categorize everything, reorganize your list, and\nbegin ranking the items from things that affect you most to\nthe least.\n4. Choose the top items from each list and create an action\nitem on what you plan to do in order to remove it from your\nenvironment. Choose only what would be manageable and\npossible for you to remove without making you prone to\neven more stress (this would defeat the purpose of the\nexercise). Start small and after you’ve become acquainted\nwith the changes and see the impact, you can begin\neliminating other things.\n\nFramework For Creating A Non-Thinking Environment\nWrite down all of the things that help you get into a relaxed,\npeaceful, non-thinking state. These can be things like exercise,\nmeditation, having a certain genre of music on, location, etc.\nOrganize the items on your list into categories.\n1. Examples Of Categories\nI. Physical Health\na. What things that you put into your body help you to feel healthy,\nsustainably energized, and peaceful?\nII. Physical Environment\na. What things in your physical environment help you feel aligned\nwith your divine self?\nIII. Digital Environment\na. What things on your phone, computer, or TV help you to feel\naligned with your divine self?\nIV. Digital Consumption\na. What media/content you consume helps you to feel aligned with\nyour highest self?\n2. Rank the items in each category from most impactful to\nleast impactful to helping you get into and remain in a\nnonthinking state.\n3. Choose the top items from each list and create an action\nitem on how you will incorporate it into your life. Try not\nto do too much at once because it can be overwhelming. Do\nwhat is manageable for you for now and you can add on\nmore later after you’ve become acquainted with it.\n4. Create an activation ritual or morning routine that helps\nyou get into a state of non-thinking and helps you align\nwith your highest self. Plan out what the ideal morning\nroutine looks like that you can do now. Start small and don’t\n\noverwhelm yourself. Ensure that there is time for you to\ncreate space (like meditation, yoga, or any similar spiritual\npractice to help you tune into Infinite Intelligence).\n5. How you start your day will create momentum for how\nyour day will go. If you start your day off by checking your\nphone, emails and what you have to do, you’re starting your\nday in a stressful, fight or flight mode of thinking, which\nwill carry on for the rest of the day.\n6. If you begin your day in a peaceful state and perform a\nroutine that gets you into a state of non-thinking, you will\ncarry that momentum throughout your day and it will be\nmuch harder to get caught up in external things that could\nmake you relapse back into thinking and stress. This is why\nall the greatest spiritual masters have morning rituals or\nroutines of some kind.\nFramework For Implementing Non-Thinking Into Your\nWork\n1. Create a list of things you do in your work that drain you\nof energy — things that you don’t like doing or just feel\noverall heavy in your work.\n2. Create a list of things you do in your work that gives you\nenergy — things that make you feel inspired, energetic,\nalive, and light.\n3. Go back through your whole list and give a rating for\neach activity that you do on a scale from 1-10 with 1 being\nextremely energy draining and 10 making you feel the\nmost alive and inspired when you do it.\n\n4. Each week, eliminate 1-3 things from your energy\ndraining list and do more of the activities that are a 9 and\n10 on your list.\n5. The goal is to get to a point where you’re spending 80% of\nyour work time doing things that are a 9 and 10 on your\nlist.\nA Guide To Overcoming Destructive Habits/Behaviors\nAs you create more space and begin not thinking as much,\nyou’ll quickly discover that you will become aware of a lot of\nnegative, destructive habits you may have that keep making\nyou more prone to suffering. This is completely okay. Do not\nbeat yourself up about it because it will only make things worse.\nHere is a more detailed guide below that will help you break any\ndestructive habits:\n1. Become aware of what behavior you want to change and\nconfirm that it is something you genuinely want to alter.\nUnderstand that if you want to change and stop the vicious\ncycle of suffering, you’re going to have to change and let go\nof the beliefs you’re holding onto that are creating the\nsuffering. If you don’t want to change it, there’s no point in\ncontinuing forward, but if you do want to change, then let’s\nbegin the process of letting go.\n2. Write down in exact, meticulous detail what happens\nwith this behavior (how many times it happens, when it\nhappens, etc.) Don’t spare any details.\n3. What are you feeling in the moment right before you\nbegin the behavior? What’s the feeling that triggers the\nbehavior? Be honest with yourself.\n\n4. What specific thinking patterns are going on? What are\nyou saying to yourself in the moment when this\nhappens? Describe it in exact detail.\n5. What beliefs do you have around this habit? What\nconclusions have you made which compel you to feel like\nyou HAVE to perform this behavior/action?\n6. How do you feel when you believe that thinking?\n7.
